            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Age we live in, pretending to ſo much ſubtilty, and the liberty of writing Intrigues, being grown ſo common; to prevent publick miſtakes, I have thought good to premiſe this Advertiſement; That theſe <hi>Annals of Love</hi> are really Hiſtory, whoſe Fountains and Originals, I have on purpoſe inſerted in the enſuing Table. They are no witty and facetious Inventions, exhibited under true Names (of which kind I have ſeen lately an ingenious Eſſay) but faithful touches taken out of Hiſtory in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. There was formerly a Counteſs of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who ran away from her Husband with a Pilgrim into <hi>France.</hi> There were <hi>Fraticelles,</hi> and they condemned for the ſame Crimes by <hi>Boniface VIII.</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment V.</hi> Let no man expect a Scheme of our preſent Hypocriſie in this Book; he that does, will be miſtaken, and find nothing but a faithful Relation of the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of old times. I confeſs I have preſumed to add ſome Ornaments to the ſimplicity of Hiſtory: The Majeſty of Hiſtorical matters will not allow a judicious Author to dilate upon Accidents of Love, he ſpeaks of them but <hi>in tranſitu,</hi> and it muſt be no leſs than an eminent Battel, or the ſubverſion of a State, contempt him to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.
<pb facs="tcp:65131:3"/>I have excuſed my Annals for this ſort of auſterity. When the Hiſtory of <hi>Spain</hi> tells me a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Counteſs of <hi>Caſtile</hi> followed a poor Pilgrim into <hi>France,</hi> I cannot imagine things could run ſo high in a moment: they muſt ſee one another, they muſt meet, and diſcourſe, before ſhe could come to ſo ſtrange a reſolution. I have augmented the Hiſtory therefore with ſeveral Enterviews, and amorous Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of mine own: If they are not what they really ſpake, they are at leaſt what they might. I have no Memoires to truſt to, but my own Fancy; when I am better ſupplied, or aſſured my Gallants delivered themſelves better than I have made them in my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, I will be content with all my heart, to have my Complements expunged, and their own put in their places. But conſidering the Hiſtorians do all render them mute, why ſhould not I make them ſpeak as I think good my ſelf.</p>
            <p>If in the Conferences and Paſſages I have invented, there happens any reſemblance with the Intrigues of our Age, it is no fault either in the Hiſtory or in me, that was writ long before I was born, and I proteſt I thought nothing of the preſent, when I ſpake of what was paſt. But there having been Lovers, and loving from the beginning of the World, it is hard to conceive but thoſe who have been always ſuſceptible of the ſame ſentiments, will be liable to the ſame actions. A man is a man now, as he was ſix hundred years ſince. The Law of our Anceſtors is ours, and we love, as they loved formerly: Is it to be admired then, if what happened in former Ages, bears a Conformity with ours? It is no more extraordinary to ſee a Lover in <hi>1669.</hi> make Love as they did in <hi>950.</hi> than it is to ſee
<pb facs="tcp:65131:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>a Child born this year with the ſame Members or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which compoſed the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> and the Patriarchs. Theſe are the common effects of Nature, not ſubject to the revolutions of time; and I cannot but wonder people ſhould be ſo idle, as to Philoſophize upon ſo natural a ſimilitude. Beſides this, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to comprehend a Moral ſenſe in all things, though (apparently) never ſo irregular. If I bring in a Religious perſon ſpeaking abominably, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Sanctity of his Name and Profeſſion, 'tis but to render that kind of Impiety the more horrible, and to illuſtrate the Excellence of Vertue: If I drive on the Immodeſty of Women even to Impudence, 'tis but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent that Vice in its more natural Colours. Indeed it is many times dangerous to give a feeble and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect deſcription, in ſome caſes a Woman may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by a temptation, which (had ſhe known all the conſequences of the Hiſtory) ſhe would probably have maſter'd. And that I might interlace, and inlay my Examples with profitable Precepts, I obſerve this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime in all of them, to puniſh Vice, and reward Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. With this Caution it is lawful to bring the moſt deteſtable action upon the Stage. The Scenes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and Colledges are filled with Aſſaſinations and Murders; Sacriledge and Martyrdom, we ſee fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently confounded; and yet there is no thoughts of putting them down. As the Crime is not expoſed, but for the Triumph of Innocence, ſo no body hath ſo ill an opinion of his Neighbour, as to take that for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to Vice, which is but an ingenious way to diſcourage it. I conjure the Readers of my Annals <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o have a care of that fault; they may meet Vice in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:65131:4"/>them take notice alſo, if they pleaſe, theſe Pictures were drawn but to render it more ugly. The Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical ſenſe makes good the literal all along, and the liberty of the ſtyle, which perhaps runs high now and then in ſerious occaſions, ought to be looked upon but as deſigns of diverſion, otherwiſe they will injure the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Author, who meant no more than their divertiſement.</p>

               <p>This Extravagance is in Hiſtory repreſented ſo horridly, I thought it my duty to give it a better ſhape. <hi>Dulcinus</hi> and <hi>Marguerite</hi> introduced a cuſtom of promiſcuous injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all ſorts of people, without choice or diſtinction. I have moderated that, and turned it to the changing of Husbands and Wives, which though it be contrary likewiſe to the Laws of the Church; yet among Perſons of Honour, I think it would be more excuſable than the other. As to <hi>Nogaret,</hi> there was a man of that Train, at that time accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by <hi>Sara Colonna</hi> into <hi>Italy:</hi> and ſuppoſing there was ſuch an Examen of Husbands diſcontented, and Wives not ſatisfied, it is not improbable but their Arguments and Impeachments might be of that nature.</p>

               <head>THE FIRST PART.</head>
               <p>LOVE is agreeable in all forms, and hath its influence upon all perſons. We have ſeen Queens in Love with the meaneſt of their Officers; it reigns in the dull and almoſt dead eye, as well as in the brisk and ſparkling: nor is there any Condition of Mankind, from the Prince to the Pilgrim, but ſtoops to that yoke, and may become an Ornament of its Triumph. Of this the Counteſs of <hi>Caſtile</hi> is a moſt pregnant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65131:6"/>She was deſcended from the Illuſtrious Family of the <hi>Vermandois,</hi> ſhe was a great Beauty, and married to a Count, whoſe Eſtate ſince that time hath compoſed a conſiderable Kingdom. His Court was numerous, and the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Gallantry, the moſt remarkable in all <hi>Spain.</hi> But it was not with the Charms of a Courtier, the Counteſs was to be won, her Vertue was impregnable as to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificence, or Spruceneſs; it muſt be a Hat with large brims, a Rochet ſet with ſhells, muſt work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her. The Luſtre of that Diadem to which her Husband <hi>Don Garcia Fernandez</hi> was born, made leſs impreſſion upon her heart, than the counterfeit hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of a Pilgrim of S. <hi>James.</hi> This Hero tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling to <hi>Compoſtella</hi> through the Kingdom of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi> and underſtanding the Counteſs was originally <hi>French,</hi> and particularly gracious to that Nation, he reſolved to have his ſhare of it as well as the reſt of his Country-men. He got himſelf preſented by the Maſter of the Hoſpital at <hi>Burgos;</hi> where being received, and the excellence of his <hi>Meen</hi> piercing through the obſcurity of his habit, the Counteſs found him immediately ſo compleat, ſhe retarded the accompliſhment of his Vow for ſome weeks, ſhe conjured him to repoſe himſelf for ſome time at her Court in <hi>Caſtile;</hi> and becauſe his Equipage was not likely to render him conſiderable, ſhe found out a pretence to furniſh him more nobly her ſelf. There was not a Family in <hi>France</hi> to which he ſaid he was allied, but was akin likewiſe to the Counteſs: ſo covering the real indigence of her Pilgrim with the Mask of voluntary Penance, he was introduced into the Court under the Name
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65131:6"/>of <hi>Hugo d'Anjou deſcended from the Counts of</hi> Guien <hi>firſt Couſins to the Counteſs,</hi> and <hi>that out of an exceſs of Devotion he was marching in Pilgrimage to</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtella. He could not have had better Titles to recommend him in that Country; for <hi>Don Garcias</hi> loved his Wife very well, and the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> are a people naturally ſenſible of any act of Devotion. Thus far therefore our <hi>Hugo</hi> is happy, being lodged in the Counts own Palace, and reverenced by his whole Court for the profound humility which they ſuppoſed in him. His change of Habit could be no diſadvantage to him; it is not to be imagined, but he was as graceful to the eyes of the Counteſs in the Faſhion of a <hi>French</hi> Lord, as in the Weeds of a Pilgrim. She made him tell her the Adventures of his Voyage, and preſſed it with as much importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as was poſſible, ſhe would not ſuffer him to omit the leaſt Circumſtance, and for as much as good Lodging is a rare Commodity among Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, and he had occaſion ſometimes to mention the unkindneſs of the Servants where he lay, the good Lady was ſo tender-hearted, and ſo ſenſible of his ſufferings, ſhe could not forbear blurting out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He was perpetually attending, and indeed ſo much that his aſſiduity would have been ſuſpicious in any body but a Couſin. He was always ready with ſome pleaſant Story or other, when ever ſhe commanded, he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered conſtantly the beſt flowers for his Lady Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, and her Chamber; and then cutting off his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes with ſudden and moſt profound ſighs (which were eaſily diſtinguiſhable from throbs of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) he inſpired ſo much Curioſity into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, that nothing could ſerve her turn but the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of his Life, ſhe preſt him very hard, ſhe muſt have every Accident, and <hi>Hugo</hi> was ſo cunning to let her preſs as often as he thought was neceſſary, to make his compliance the more grateful, at length he did it in this manner.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Hiſtory of the Pilgrim.</head>
                  <p>I Will not tell you, Madam, that I am of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily hath reckoned Kings of <hi>France</hi> among it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65131:7"/>Predeceſſors. The ridiculous Proverb, that <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers may lye by authority,</hi> renders Strangers ſo ſuſpectible of that vanity, that the beſt way to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ones Quality, is to conceal it. Here the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs interrupted him, and pretending to know him better than he knew himſelf, ſhe ran out into ſo large a Genealogy of his Illuſtrious Anceſtors, that ſhe ſaved him the trouble of inventing one; ſhe deduced him from <hi>Eudes,</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> Earls of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou,</hi> Governors of the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> III. ſirnamed the Simple, and quoted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hiſtorical Chronologies to prove it, which perhaps ſhe had never ſeen in her life, ſo that the Nobility of his Extractions coſt him nothing but two or three nods with his head by way of concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and confirmation.</p>
                  <p>Since then, Madam, continued the Pilgrim, I find you ſo well verſed in my Pedigree, I ſhall trouble you with nothing but the affairs of my heart.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs bluſht at that word, and <hi>Hugo</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it well enough, but like a cunning Sophiſter, took no notice, but went on with his Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>I was never aimable enough to be beloved; had I ever had that good fortune, I would have dyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would have betrayed it: but (having been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ill treated) I may confeſs (without indiſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) I have had ſome little inclinations formerly to a Lady of our Court, of as great Beauty and Quality as moſt that were there. Her cruelty rather than any inconſtancy in me, diſingaged me in a ſhort time; and ſince, but why? Madam, ſaid he (as if he had recollected himſelf) ſhall I be ſo vain, as to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65131:8"/>my own weakneſſes? Yes, yes, I will do it. You are an excellent perſon, and I have already had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of your goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>I had framed an Idea of Beauty to my ſelf, which I worſhipped at my ſoul, but could not meet with it in any perſon I could find: this pleaſant <hi>Chimera</hi> entertained me whole days, I was unquiet, made Verſes, as I had been in Love, I deſcribed her with the beſt Eyes, the beſt Mouth, the beſt Hair, made her ſhape incomparable, her ſmile bewitching, and when I had done, gave up my ſoul wholly to the adoration of the Picture, though if my ſoul had been at ſtake, I knew not where to have found out the Original. This paſſion bordering much upon folly, I was not a little aſhamed of my ſelf, and the inſtances of my reaſon tormenting me with remorſe, as often as the pleaſantneſs of the folly inveigled my deſires, I became ſo melancholy, I was hardly to be known. A particular Friend of mine, a man of great ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, was the firſt which perceived it, he asked me the cauſe, and our intimacy not permitting me to diſſemble, I told him the truth. He had more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience for my Phrenſie, than I expected he would have had, for though he was ſevere to himſelf, he had great kindneſs for his friends. He judged by the relation I had made of my follies, that Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, or Arguments would do but little good, and therefore concluded upon another way of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me relief; He caſt my Nativity, rectified his Figure moſt accurately, and according to the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Rules of that Art, and at laſt found, that if any thing reſtored me to my former tranquillity, it muſt be a Pilgrimage to Saint <hi>James.</hi> I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65131:8"/>at the Propoſition; people of my Age and Quality, do not reliſh thoſe exceſſes of devotion: But the hopes wherewith my paſſion had been flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, having tranſported it to the higheſt degree of irregularity, it was not poſſible for me to reſiſt its violence any longer; I put my affairs in as good a poſture as my impatience would give me leave, and colouring my Journey with a ſpecious pretence, that it was a Vow my Father had taken before, that dying of a ſudden, he had injoyned me to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it for him, I began my Pilgrimage. This, Madam, is the true reaſon that hath tranſported me from <hi>Hugo d'Anjou,</hi> to a poor Pilgrim of S. <hi>James,</hi> and though I cannot ſay my ſubmiſſion to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Heavens, hath moved them to compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate my folly, or attribute it to the effect of a Sympathy with which I dare not flatter my ſelf; yet this I do certainly find, that my deſires are tending to their accompliſhments, that my mind is more at eaſe in <hi>Burgos</hi> than in any other place, and that the favours you are pleaſed to vouchſafe me, do afford more conſolation to my diſquiets than I could be capable of receiving from any one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
                  <p>The politick Pilgrim durſt not explain himſelf any farther the firſt time, but reſerved it to future Converſation to make himſelf more intelligible, the Character of his Chimerical Miſtreſs, anſwered exactly to the qualifications of the Counteſs, and he loſt no opportunity of inculcating the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, to which the diſpoſition of the Stars contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted very largely. The Counteſs was the Wife of a Soveraign Prince, and in appearance inclined
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65131:9"/>naturally to Vertue; but when one is carried away with an opinion of the Celeſtial Influence, there is no room left for the Counſels either of Honour or Reaſon. No doubt but the good Lady was ſorry at the heart for the fatality of her Stars, but ſhe did not believe it was poſſible to evade them. She would have ſworn her adventure was decreed from the Creation of the World, and how then could ſhe withſtand ſo firm a predeſtination? She yielded therefore without any farther reluctancy; the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim ſpake his mind, and it was favourably recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and that I may not ſpin out more time in the inſinuation of a thing ſo eaſily comprehended, <hi>Hugo</hi>'s affection languiſht not above a month in the agonies of its diſcovery: having paſt ſo painful an obſtetrication, the Counteſs and he began to uſe more liberty in their converſe. But is it poſſible, ſaid ſhe to him one day, that the accidents you have related to me of your life, ſhould be true? But is it poſſible, replied the Pilgrim, you can doubt it after what you have ſeen? Am not I <hi>Hugo d'Anjou?</hi> Was not I going for <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> when I had the happineſs to ſee you? Did I not adore you from the firſt moment I beheld you, and if I may believe your gracious glances, were not you ſenſible from the firſt, of the Love you had kindled in me?

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igh, this Deſtiny you ſpeak of hath taken but an odd kind of way to arrive at its ends, for it might well have excuſed making me the Wife of a Prince, ſeeing I was born to be the Miſtreſs of a Pilgrim: at this rate they had ſeveral Diſcourſes; their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Conſanguinity furniſhing them with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected liberty of entertaining themſelves when they pleaſed, but this was not ſufficient for our Pilgrim. He was in perpetual fear ſomething or other ſhould be diſcovered, which might be fatal either to his Love, or his life; and not being able to continue at <hi>Burgos</hi> much longer in that anxiety, he ventured to propoſe to the Counteſs to bear him company her ſelf. The motion was ſomewhat ſudden, but ſhe was more ſurprized than offended when ſhe heard it, and no wonder; for a Woman which once yields up her heart to diſloyalty, makes no ſcruple of running forward upon whatever ſhe is deſired; the greateſt difficulty was, to find a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretence. The firſt thing they pitcht upon was a Pilgrimage, which had been ſo favourable already to <hi>Hugo</hi>'s deſigns, they expected no leſs in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Counteſs. But <hi>Don Garcias</hi> was inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, they deſpaired to prevail with him; he could not endure to be ſo long from his Wife, who pretended neceſſities and revelations, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he was deaf to all her inſpirations, and had he not fallen into a deſperate ſit of ſickneſs (as it had been in revenge of his obſtinacy) he had never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Counteſſes peregrination: But the danger he was in, giving her the pretence of a vow for his recovery, and the approbation of certain
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65131:10"/>good Chriſtians (of which that Climate is very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile) having fortified her reſolution; ſhe promiſed ſolemnly in the preſence of the great Officers of the Court to go on foot to Saint <hi>James,</hi> if it pleaſed God to reſtore her Husband to his health. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, to the great ſatisfaction of our Lovers, and the Counteſs counterfeiting the fear of his relapſe, if ſhe did not accompliſh her Vow with all poſſible ſpeed, uſed her utmoſt endeavour, that ſhe might accompany her Couſin in his religious Voyage. This extravagant zeal diſpleaſed <hi>Don Garcias</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, he would have choſen a ſecond diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, rather than the departure of his Wife: But the Religious people in <hi>Burgos</hi> belaboured his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo hotly, they overcame it at laſt, and the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Counteſs was permitted to march. In this manner ſhe was turned Pilgrim, and upon her way to <hi>Compoſtella</hi> with her well beloved Couſin. The ſlenderneſs of her Equipage being an eſſential part of her Vow, ſhe would let no body attend her but an old Governeſs, (very ſubject to compaſſion for the frailties of Nature) and a Foot-man, which by the conſent of all Authors, ſerved all Offices, and was ſometimes the <hi>French</hi> Cook, and ſometimes Gentleman Uſher. Such extraordinary Pilgrims as theſe, ought to have no ordinary Conduct: they advanced by ſmall Journeys; whatever was better than ordinary in their Inns, they would be ſure to have it; if Muſick, and Songs were to be had, they would have their ſhare: and now I ſpeak of Songs, it puts me in mind of a few Verſes in the nature of a Satyr made upon their Pilgrimage, which I hope the Reader will not take unkindly, if I inſert in this place.</p>

                  <p>The deſign of our Lovers being to follow the Road to <hi>Compoſtella</hi> no longer than needs muſt; the Counteſſes Magazins were provided for a much greater Journey: ſhe had Money, and Jewels good ſtore, and the Lacquay being very well choſen, they fetcht a ſhort turn, and recovered by his induſtry whatever was convenient for their progreſs to <hi>Bayonne.</hi> They repoſed there for ſome time, and her Honour not thinking it fit to retain the name of <hi>Iſabel de Vermandois,</hi> by which ſhe was called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Don Garcias</hi> Wife, ſhe aſſumed the Title of <hi>Madame Valerie,</hi> with which ſhe paſt ſeveral Cities and Towns, till at length ſhe arrived in <hi>Paris,</hi> a place more proper to conceal her Intrigues, than any other, and moreover it was the place where
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65131:11"/>her Gallant was born. The Pedigree of this Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim proved not ſo Illuſtrious as he had hinted at <hi>Burgos;</hi> he was ſcarce a Gentleman, and but mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided with Eſtate, but the merit of the man ſupplied his defects.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Don Garcias</hi> (who conſented to the Pilgrimage of his Wife, with no little regret) began to be impatient for her return. He could not take a nap, but he lookt upon it as ominous, the commoneſt Accidents paſt for Prodigies with him; and though the Counteſs writ to him from all places, and dated her Letters from the Road to <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> yet he had a ſecret Devil tormented him violently, and nothing could ſatisfie him, but he muſt go after her himſelf. He departed from <hi>Burgos</hi> without any Train, only ſome certain neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Officers, and two or three of his moſt intimate Courtiers, ſuppoſing he had not had above two or three days Journeys to his Counteſs, he ordered his affairs at home according to the propoſed time of his abſence, but he was miſtaken in his ſcale, and might have gone twenty times to <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> and never heard of his Wife, had not the curioſity of ſome people ſhortned his Journey. The perſons which attended him, growing weary of their Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and (perhaps) ſuſpecting the truth, reſolved amongſt themſelves to try if they could diſcover the buſineſs, inſtead, of inquiring upon the Road to <hi>Galicia,</hi> they ſent towards <hi>France,</hi> for Intelligence that way, and it was no hard matter to inform them: For the Counteſs was remarkable, and all the deſcriptions that were made of <hi>Madame Valery,</hi> anſwered exactly to the Counteſs of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> News

He had often ſuppoſed that the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this Pilgrimage might deliver the two Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins from the ſcruple of Inceſt pretended; but he could not believe the Counteſs could carry it on far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſome few falſe oaths of conjugal fidelity. He queſtioned the old Domeſtick, and the more queſtions he askt, the more he was informed; and yet not being able to convince himſelf of ſo incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible a thing, he could not without great difficulty believe what he ſaw.</p>
                  <p>He diſpatcht new Scouts upon the heels of the old; he gave order for purſuing the Pilgrims, not only where he judged they might poſſible be, but in ſuch places likewiſe where he was aſſured they were not. Theſe Hue and Crys confirmed him in what had been told him; he received atteſtations from all the Inns where the devout Lovers had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed betwixt <hi>Burgos</hi> and <hi>Bayonne,</hi> and of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they uſed. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> underſtood ſo many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities

                  <p>The Star that was ſo fatal to the Husband this year, had not confined its influence to the Climate of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> the cold as well as hot Countries felt the force of that Conſtellation. Earl <hi>Ethelwold</hi> a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite to <hi>Edgar</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> had gained ſo far upon the affections of his Majeſty, that he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned both his Subjects and deſires as abſolutely as himſelf. This King acted nothing but by his Counſels, ſaw nothing but by his Eyes, and as if he had been to love nothing but with his heart, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted him to go and view a young Lady called <hi>Alfreda,</hi> (Daughter and Heir to the Duke of <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> one of the greateſt Lords in that Kingdom) of whom he had heard ſo well, that if his Favourite ſound her as ſhe was repreſented, he reſolved to make her his Wife.

                     </gap>ing all the Civility could be ſhewed him, the Daughter was called down, to bear a part in the acknowledgments. Never did old Story ſpeak
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65131:13"/>of any Lady with ſo much advantage as the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Chronicle does of <hi>Alfreda:</hi> the deſcription made of her therein, reliſhes more of Romance than veritable Narration; and yet the effects her Beauty produced were ſo ſtrange, and ſo great, they ſeem to juſtifie the Elogy they gave her. The Count was dazled at the very firſt glance, and this ſurpriſe was preſently converted into a violent paſſion, and that into a reſolution never to put her into the arms of his Maſter. He proceeded preſently to a Treaty, but it was for himſelf, thereby teaching Poſterity, that in matters of Love they ſhould never give their Agents ſo abſolute a power, as may tempt them to abuſe it. There being no perſon in the Court of <hi>England</hi> ſo great as <hi>Ethelwold,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Devon-ſhire</hi> took the Propoſition as a very great Honour, and granted it without any demur, ſo that all things being concluded, and nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conſummate all but the Nuptial Benediction, <hi>Ethelwold</hi> gave the Duke to underſtand, that in duty he was obliged to let his Majeſty know of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; under which pretence he took his leave of the Duke for ſome time, and returned preſently to Court, where he gave <hi>Edgar</hi> a deſcription of <hi>Alfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> quite contrary to what he had already concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. True it is, Sir, ſaid the Count to the King; <hi>Alfreda</hi> has all things about her requiſite to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Lady handſom, and yet with all thoſe ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, ſhe is far from it her ſelf. She has an ill Meen, which diſcredits her ſhape, ſhe has a red Lip, but without any ſweetneſs; her Eyes are large, grey, and well ſet, but ſhe has a way of opening them, which renders them abominable; her looks
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65131:13"/>are ſo childiſh, and ſilly, they take much from the excellence of her Complexion; in ſhort, Sir, the features and proportions of this Lady are not made for one another, they are ſo hudled together, their confuſion ſpoils their retail, and never was there perſon before the Duke of <hi>Devon-ſhires</hi> Daughter that had ſo much hard favourdneſs, and ſo much Beauty together. To this extravagant Character <hi>Ethelwold</hi> added certain pretended reaſons of his own; as that ſince the Duke of <hi>Devon-ſhire</hi> had been baniſht the Court, he had contracted great debts, and ingaged a conſiderable part of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to the Earls and Dukes that were his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; that he was odious to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> that his Journey into <hi>Devon-ſhire</hi> having given ſome Alarm, and ſuſpicion, the people began already to declaim againſt the Match, and in this manner imploying all parts to divert his Majeſty from thoſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient deſires; he wrought upon him ſo, that he gave over his deſign. But this ſingle effect of his Counſels could not content him, he knew <hi>Edgar</hi> was of an amorous Complexion, and he muſt find out ſomething or other to entertain him. <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wold</hi> ſent up and down, inquired himſelf, and it was not long before he was provided; <hi>England</hi> is not barren of Beauties, and it was a Miſtreſs for his Majeſty he wanted. He pitcht therefore upon a young Lady called <hi>Wilfrede,</hi> who had withdrawn her ſelf into a Monaſtery to avoid the inſolences of her Guardian. She was young, unfortunate, and next the Dukes Daughter the handſomeſt Woman in that Kingdom. The Count preſented her to the King to obtain his protection againſt her Guardian,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65131:14"/>who would needs marry her to a perſon ſhe could not poſſibly love; and ſeconding his Harangue with all the commendations he could give her, he repreſented the good qualities of <hi>Wilfrede</hi> with ſuch efficary, that before ſhe left the King, ſhe received ſenſible marks of his inclination. <hi>Ethelwold</hi> liked his ſucceſs very well, he uſed her with all kindneſs and compaſſion, undertook to be her Mediator in that affair, and in a ſhort time managed things ſo, that he had brought her to his Lure, and got an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute command of her. Finding the King ingaged with this Lady, he took occaſion to renew his Counſels againſt the Duke of <hi>Devon-ſhire,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended advice of intelligence betwixt him and the Duke of <hi>Normandy;</hi> and preſſing his Majeſty to put a ſtop to the ambition of this man, by marrying his Daughter to one of his Subjects, it fell naturally into the Kings head to beſtow her upon him. It is eaſie to believe he conſented without any great trouble, and yet he called it a Sacrifice, pretending that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freda</hi> was her ſelf ſo unacceptable to him, that no conſideration but the Peace of the Nation could have prevailed with him to marry her. But to ſerve his Maſter, and advantage the Nation, what was it he would not readily endure? At length having uſed all the <hi>Grimaces</hi> and Artifice he could think of, <hi>Ethelwold</hi> is diſpatcht into <hi>Devon-ſhire</hi> to marry the Dukes Daughter, for the tranquillity of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Never was any man ſo happy as this Lover, he admired <hi>Alfreda,</hi> even to adoration; he eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her a thouſand times more handſom ſince ſhe was his Wife than before, and though it was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience only which obliged <hi>Alfreda</hi> to marry him,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65131:14"/>having never loved any thing but him. The bare act of Marriage wrought as effectually upon the heart of this young Lady, as long Love did upon other people. The preſence of her Husband was quickly dear to her, ſhe apprehended his abſence; and perceiving him laying his deſign of returning whither his ambition called him: Ah, Sit, ſaid ſhe to him one day, this is that I have been always afraid of; the Loves of a Servant, and a Husband are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly different, I remember a roguiſh Song my Governeſs taught me when I was a Child, which I fear contains a fatal prediction of my deſtiny: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid ſo, with an innocent ſmile that almoſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed her Husband, ſhe began to repeat them.</p>

                  <p>No, no, dear <hi>Alfreda,</hi> replied the amorous <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wold,</hi> catching her faſt in his arms, nothing ſhall ever extinguiſh the paſſion I have for you. I am too much enamoured, and you are too handſom not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65131:15"/>to be always the Miſtreſs of your Hasband. Why, this leaving me then, my Lord? replied the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly <hi>Alfreda,</hi> could you leave me ſo ſoon, if you loved me as you ſay? Nay, my Dear, replied the Count, my Journey is of neceſſity, I muſt needs go where my duty requires me, would you have me renounce the favour of my Prince, the advantages it beings me, and the care of the State, which his moſt gracious Majeſty hath committed (almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely) to my Conduct? What neceſſity of this State, replied <hi>Alfreda,</hi> or thoſe Chimerical advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates? Is not the Duke my Father rich, and great enough to erect you a Fortune? And can you think that when I cannot enjoy you, the thought of your travelling for the good of the Nation, will give me any eaſe? Ah, my Lord, let us conſider our own private felicity, and leave the general to others; the ſatisfaction, and pleaſantneſs of the whole World, will not wipe off one of the tears your departure will being upon my cheeks: and to tell you may final reſolution in a word, either you muſt be kind, and ſtay here with me, or ſo merciful as to let me bear you Company, otherwiſe God knows what danger there will be of our meeting no more. Theſe two Propoſitions were equally fatal to the Count, he uſed all his Art to reduce her to reaſon. He loved <hi>Alfreda</hi> very well, and his Fortune no leſs; he was conſcious of the cheat he had put upon the King, and he had no mind his Wife ſhould come to Court to convince him. He excuſed himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the illneſs of the weather, he promiſed to return again very ſpeedily: But the new Bride would not be paid in that Coin; ſhe charged him

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65131:16"/>as Queen, but for the Treachery of <hi>Ethelwold,</hi> ſHe gave her ſelf over to Melancholy, ſo that nothing could comfort her. The Duke imagining this ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had proceeded from the abſence of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, aſſured her conſtantly of his ſpeedy return. He ſhewed her the Letters he had received to that purpoſe, and uſed all means poſſible to divert her: But it was not the ſight of her Conſort ſhe longed for, ſhe feared it as much now as ſhe had deſired it before. Whilſt her thoughts were in this agitation, a Painter arrived at that City, who went from Court to Court to make a collection of the Pictures of all the fine Ladies in <hi>Europe,</hi> to hang up in the Gallery of his Maſter the Duke of <hi>Modena.</hi> This Picture-drawer had heard much of the Beauty of <hi>Alfreda</hi> from a <hi>French</hi>-man of his acquaintance in <hi>Rome,</hi> who had been ſome time in <hi>England:</hi> Upon the report of this <hi>French</hi>-man, he concluded he could carry nothing more grateful to his Maſter than the Picture of this Lady. He came therefore to <hi>Davon,</hi> and having withal due formality, begged leave of the old Duke that his Daughter might ſit, he obtained it without any ſcruple. The Old man loved his Daughter very tenderly, and not knowing his Son in Laws Intrigue, he thought the giving her Picture but an indifferent thing: But the Counteſs lookt upon it in another nature; ſhe contributed all her power to make it more amiable, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhe had hit her deſign, and her Picture very well done, ſhe told the Painter, if he would acouit himſelf well of his Commiſſion, he muſt go to the Court of <hi>Edgar,</hi> where the greateſt Beauties were; but the Painter intended that before. The <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:65131:16"/>Women in all Ages have been allowed the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt in the World, and though the <hi>Italian</hi> and got the choice of all in the Picture of the new Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, yet he muſt needs have <hi>Wilfredes</hi> too, for the reputation ſhe had of being the Kings Miſtreſs. As ſoon therefore as he had diſpatcht in <hi>Devon-ſhire,</hi> he repaired to <hi>London;</hi> but <hi>Alfrede</hi> having diſpatcht ſome of her Creatures before, ſhe cauſed a report to be ſpread abroad under-hand of an <hi>Italian</hi> Painter, who was coming thither with moſt admirable Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. She had been told that <hi>Edgar</hi> was very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in Pictures. She hoped by this means he might come to have a ſight of hers, and be taken out of the errour the Count had drawn him into, without her contribution: Nor was ſhe miſtaken in her fore-caſt. The King would needs ſee his Pictures as ſoon as he heard he was arrived: And though the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> had directed him to ſhew them to very few perſons, the liberality of the King removed that difficulty. When a thing is deſired in that way by a King, he is ſeldom denied. The <hi>Italian</hi> promiſed <hi>Edgar</hi> he ſhould ſee the beſt he had, and the King choſe <hi>Wilfreds</hi> Chamber to ſee them in, as being deſirous to have her ſhare in the divertiſement. The Painter beſeeched that he would bring as few with him as he could, and to comply with his deſign, <hi>Ethelwold</hi> was the only Perſon had the Priviledge to attend him. The firſt Picture the Painter took up was <hi>Eleonor,</hi> Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> married afterwards to <hi>Lewis</hi> (ſirnamed <hi>le Jeune</hi>) King of <hi>France.</hi> Hiſtory has repreſented this Lady ſo beautiful, it will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in me to deſcribe her: She it was that charmed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65131:17"/>the brave <hi>Saladin</hi> General of an Army of <hi>Sarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens;</hi> and having let him know that ſhe could not believe his proteſtations of Love, unleſs delivered in her own language, ſhe forced the great Captain to betake himſelf to his Book, and to ſtudy the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, which he attained in ſome ſociable proportion in a fortnight. After her came the Picture of <hi>Elvira,</hi> Miſtreſs to <hi>Ramire</hi> the Conquerour, who firſt erected the County of <hi>Arragon</hi> into a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Ethelwold</hi> who knew the ſtory very well, and had a mind to be entertaining of <hi>Wilfred,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them the relation, he told the King. This <hi>Elvira</hi> is a famous Example, that Honour and Love are not incompatible in the heart of great Perſons. Never was Prince more renowned than <hi>Ramire;</hi> they reckoned his Victories by the number of his days, and yet he thought Love ſo neceſſary to his Courage, that he uſed to have his Miſtreſs in ſome weak place when he went to engage, that his deſire to preſerve her out of his Enemies hands, might oblige him to extraordinary Actions in the Battel. This kind of Hiſtory pleaſed <hi>Wilfred</hi> exceedingly, ſhe made her acknowledgments to the Count by her ſimpring, and nodding her head; and promiſing to her ſelf that he would tell her as much of every one ſhe ſhould ſee, ſhe addreſt her ſelf to him to know who that <hi>Adelaid</hi> was which the Painter was then ſhewing. She was formerly, Madam, replied the Favourite, Queen of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and dyed lately Wife to <hi>Otho</hi> the Great, who is at this day Emperour of the Weſt. The <hi>Amazonian</hi> Habit in which the Painter has drawn her, correſponds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly with the actions of her life; for ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65131:17"/>a Town in <hi>Lombardy</hi> in the abſence of her firſt Husband, as well as the beſt Captain he had: in the War <hi>Otho</hi> the Emperour had lately with the <hi>Sclavonians</hi> and <hi>Dalmatians,</hi> ſhe did him as much ſervice as the beſt of his Generals. Theſe Actions of Valour, replied <hi>Edgar,</hi> interrupting him a little, are rare in perſons of that Sex, and I cannot but commend the Judgment of the Painter in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his Pictures.</p>
                  <p>In this manner the King of <hi>England</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite were diſcourſing of the <hi>Italians</hi> Pictures, and the Count perceiving his Majeſty much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with his ſtories, there was not a Character of Beauty, a Punctilio of Art, nor the leaſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Adventure, but gave him opportunity of ſome pleaſant Narration; when of a ſudden the Painter changed the Scene of their mirth by producing the Picture of <hi>Alfreda,</hi> and ſtruck the poor Count, as it had been a clap of Thunder. The Counteſs had given him no notice that her Picture had been drawn, and ſo he was utterly unprepared againſt ſo unexpected an Accident: He lookt pale, he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and the King perceiving his diſtraction, and attributing it to his ſurprize (in which he ſhared with him himſelf) Is it poſſible, ſays he to the Painter, that this Picture ſhould be after the life? Yes, Sir, ſaid the Count, interrupting the Painter, and it is the Picture of my Wife: but ſo flatter'd, and improved, that if the other Ladies you have ſeen, be uſed at the ſame rate, I dare aſſure your Majeſty, there is no one Original to be known by its Copy. The Painter knew well enough it was no hard matter for him (in her caſe) to juſtifie the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65131:18"/>fidelity of his Art. <hi>Alfreda</hi> was much handſomer than her Picture; and ſhe was not above three or four days Journey from <hi>London:</hi> But obſerving the Count her Husband decrying her Beauty with more than ordinary vehemence, he ſuppoſed very prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he had ſome private reaſons for what he did; and being unwilling to contradict a Perſon of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, he replied very coolly, I have not ſeen, Sir, all the perſons whoſe Pictures I have with me, ſome of them are Copies, as <hi>Adelaid</hi> and <hi>Elvira,</hi> who are both of them dead, others were taken by ſome of my Companions, who have aſſiſted me in ſatisfying the impatience of my Maſter: But for thoſe I have done my ſelf, I dare aſſure his Majeſty, I have added nothing to the life. This prudent and judicious anſwer one would have thought might have eaſed the Count of his trouble; but the King was ſo ſurpriſed with the contemplation of <hi>Alfreda</hi>'s Picture, that he took no notice of what had been ſaid. What, ſays he in great tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is it poſſible but the features of this face muſt make the handſomeſt Woman in the World? Tell me, <hi>Ethelwold,</hi> and tell me ingenuouſly, has your Wife theſe Eyes, this Mouth, this Noſe, and, in ſhort, this <hi>Tour</hi> or mould of her Face. Yes, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Ethelwold,</hi> (much diſtracted with thoſe kind of queſtions) ſhe has all of them, and if your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty be pleaſed to recollect, you may remember, that in the deſcription I have of her, I told you that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an ugly Woman was ſo well provided to be handſom, and that all the features in her Face were excellent; but they are not ſo well laid and conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in her Face, as in the Picture: The Majeſtick
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65131:18"/>and vigorous Air you behold, is but the fancy and ſtrong imagination of the Painter, and not at all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the life. I will ſee this Prodigy, replied the King with ſome eagerneſs: For if <hi>Alfreda</hi> has all theſe lineaments as his Pencil has repreſented, and be ill-favour'd notwithſtanding, ſhe is in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the greateſt Miracle in the World. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Edgars</hi> made both <hi>Ethelwold</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi> tremble, and though <hi>Ethelwold</hi> did his utmoſt to conſtrain himſelf, and anſwered the King (as if he had bin nothing concerned) that his Wife would be much honoured with ſuch a Viſit, yet nothing is more certain than that he turned every ſtone that might divert his reſolution. He admoniſht <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi> to contribute what ſhe could, he counterfeited Letters that <hi>Devon</hi> was viſited with the Plague, and when he had done, opened them in the preſence of the King; he bribed all the Phyſicians to oppoſe themſelves againſt his Journey, but all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The Picture of <hi>Alfreda</hi> had inſpired ſo fierce a Curioſity in the breaſt of the King, that no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor diſſiculty could withſtand it; he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Hunting-match at a Country-houſe he had about a days journey from <hi>Devon,</hi> and reſolved to ſee the Counteſs the next day: All the Count could obtain was the liberty to go two or three hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to give the Duke notice of his coming. There is no difficurty to conceive how his thing. Its were imployed all the while he was upon the Koad. His Ambition, and his Love divided them equally. When he conſidered the crime he had committed againſt his Majeſty, in betraying his confidence, and the inevitable danger he was in of being diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65131:19"/>he believed he could do no leſs, than to deliver up his Wife with his own hands to the King, and to try how far that would work for his pardon. On the other ſide when he remembred her endued with all the Beauties which were capable to adorn her, he reſolved to dye a thouſand deaths, rather than to ſee her in the poſſeſſion of another; and this laſt reſolution being fortified with the ſight of her, he uſed all his Rhetorick to perſwade her to counterfeit her ſelf ill, and conceal her ſelf from the King. But good God! to whom was it he addreſt himſelf? <hi>Alfreda</hi> would have purchaſed that ſight he prohibited, with the loſs of her life. She told him that the humour of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf from the Kings curioſity, would but ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate and augment it; that be being King, and ſhe his Subject, he would ſee her ſome time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is he had made it his reſolution; that the beſt way was to appear cheerfully, ſeeing there was no poſſibility to avoid it. Theſe Arguments made the poor Count almoſt deſperate, but conſidering there was reaſon in what ſhe ſaid, and that the King, if he ſaw her not that day, would be ſure of her another, ſeeing ſhe conſented her ſelf, he cryed, Well then, ſee him if you pleaſe, ſee the moſt curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Monarch in the World, he is our Maſter, he will ſee you, and I know very well you are pleaſed with his reſolution: but let me deſire one thing of you, dear <hi>Alfreda,</hi> not to make the beſt of your Beauty, nor exhibit to his Eyes all the Charms with which it is in your power to attaque him: let me beg of you at leaſt to be ill dreſt, negligent, to ſpeak little, and what you do, as far as you can from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65131:19"/>
                     <hi>Alfreda</hi> made the ſame uſe of his Doctrine, as a witty Woman would do; ſhe knew (by his directions how to diſpleaſe the King) what courſe ſhe was to ſteer, to give him ſatisfaction.</p>

                  <p>Whatever he injoyned her, <hi>Alfreda</hi> did clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, never was ſhe ſo handſom, nor never ſo well dreſt. The King went away ſtrangely enamoured, he admired, and loved her already at his very ſoul, her Wit, her Air, and every thing took him; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that not being able to conceal his reſentment of the Counts infidelity, he had certainly clapt him in Priſon, had not the apprehenſion of diſpleaſing his Wife reſtrained him. It is not to be askt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Alfreda</hi> came to Court after this Viſit. <hi>Edgar</hi> found her too handſom, to ſuffer her to languiſh in the ſolitudes of the Country. He conferred great Offices and Preferments upon the Duke, to bring him nearer with his Daughter: The Duke came, and his fair Daughter along with him. <hi>Ethelwold</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:65131:20"/>forbid his Wife coming near <hi>London,</hi> but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſhe had too great a Protector to apprehend any revenge he could deſign; his beſt play was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: But ſuch kind or uſage being troubleſom to ſuch Husbands as have more the ordinary affection of their Wives; the poor Count took his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes ſo deeply, it would have been charity to have knockt him on the head. In a ſhort time he dyed of Melancholy, and the love of <hi>Edgar,</hi> being no longer reſtrained by the preſence of <hi>Ethelwold,</hi> it ran up to ſo high a degree, that no leſs than the Throne of <hi>Great Britain</hi> was able to circumſcribe it: and indeed it was not long before <hi>Alfreda</hi> was advanced to it, in ſpight of all arifices to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: the fury her Ambition exerciſed in ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a place, makes the moſt Tragick part of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>England. Wilfred</hi> was poyſoned, the Children ſhe had by the King had their throats cut, and <hi>Edward</hi> ſent out of this World, to be one of the greateſt Ornaments in the next: But theſe are acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents more proper for Tragical, than amorous An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. I deſire of the Reader I may not ſtraggle too far from my deſign, I fear <hi>Don Garcias</hi> takes it ill I have left him ſo long pining in his regrets for the loſs of his Lady, without inſerting the effects his juſt indignation did produce.</p>
                  <p>This good Count, whoſe confidence had been ſo ill requited, and who was notable to make uſe of the remedies of a diſcreet Husband (who conceals with all poſſible care his domeſtick diſorders) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his diſgrace publick all over <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and that it was ridiculous in him to ſuſpect only he was laught at, he reſolved to repair himſelf of the injury
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65131:20"/>had been done him, in ſuch a way as ſhould extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the reproach. He made his Uncle <hi>Alphonſo de Caſtile</hi> Governour in his abſence, and parting from <hi>Burgos</hi> without any Equipage but a ſingle Gentleman, he traced Madam <hi>Valery</hi> to the City of <hi>Paris.</hi> It was no eaſie matter to diſcover in that place a Woman who lived obſcurely, and whoſe Mother-tongue was the Language of that Country. And <hi>Don Garcias</hi> undertaking that difficulty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it neceſſary to get ſome aſſiſtance extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary for the accompliſhment of his deſign: he made a ſolemn Vow, that if he was ſo happy to be revenged of his old Conſort, he would take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from her debaucheries, and place her upon the Throne of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> Let not the Reader be ſurpriſed at this kind of Vow, it is not ſo fabulous as he may imagine; for it was not only made, and executed by <hi>Don Garcias,</hi> but it has paſt to his Poſterity, is the common devotion of the <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> and they believe they gain Battels ſometimes, by ſuch good intentions; nay evey in our days we have ſeen the greateſt Lords in <hi>Spain</hi> practiſe that cuſtom, as one of the moſt pious engagements in that Country. The Count of <hi>Caſtile</hi> deſirous to put himſelf into a condition of fulfilling his reſolution, and judging moreover he was moſt likely to find his Wife in the Company of looſe and licentious Women, he inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated with one of that ſort, the moſt ſubtle, and famous in <hi>Paris,</hi> he ſhewed her money enough to convince her he was worthy of her fidelity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring her to convey him amongſt the Ladies of her Acquaintance; ſhe agve him a Munſter of about twenty Harlots, all very handſom, and fine, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65131:21"/>under the protection of a rich Officer of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, which delivered the Stranger from a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable expence. Among theſe chaſt Damoiſelles, <hi>Don Garcias</hi> had an opinion he might find his Wife: the errour ſhe had committed with the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, promiſed him no leſs, but he was miſtaken, for the good Woman was more faithful to <hi>Hugo,</hi> than ſhe had been to him: he could not find her in that Inventory, nor in ſeveral others of the ſame nature which he examined afterwards. To ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his fortune more favourable, he thought his beſt way would be to haſten the accompliſhment of his Vow, and caſting his Eyes upon a brown young Laſs called <hi>Radegond,</hi> with whom the action as he thought would be more pious and charitable than any other; he intimated to his old Friend that that was the perſon he deſired to marry. His liberality had prepared the good Bawd for his ſervice; he had ſcarce ſpoke the word, but the Victime was brought to the ſoot of the Altar: The Girl was witty, never Wench better killed in the Myſteries of Love, nor underſtood the Art of Cullying better: one had need to have had good Judgment in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, to have won her to a compliance, and yet ſhe had a natural tendency to be prodigal of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; that <hi>Don Garcias</hi> had he had any deſigns upon her that way, muſt have uſed violence to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them. But he had no ſuch intention, his thoughts were only to reclaim her, and having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her a deſcription of Vice, (which was more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to her than the vice it ſelf) he promiſed her the Crown of <hi>Gaſtile,</hi> as the price of her Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The firſt part of his Sermon aſtoniſhed her,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65131:21"/>ſhe underſtood not that kind of Divinity, but the concluſion fetcht her again. The moſt diſſolute Dame of them all would promiſe Penitence for a leſs reward than a Soveraignty; and our <hi>Radegond</hi> forgot not to make uſe of her Wit at that time: She caſt her ſelf at <hi>Don Garcias</hi> feet, gave his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs many thanks for his gracious offer, and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (with an ingenuity ſhe had often counterfeited before) ſhe had never uſed any ſuch Complacency but out of pure neceſſity: She promiſed the Count ſo ſincere a Converſion, that the Ages to come ſhould ſpeak of her Piety: after what had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Don Garcias</hi> ought to have been wiſer; but he was of the temper of the Cat metamorphoſed into a Woman, and returned to his own Nature. The good Count looked upon <hi>Radegond,</hi> as a ſecond <hi>Egyptian Mary,</hi> and giving her an account of his Vow, and the cauſe of it, he conjured her by the intereſt ſhe had in its accompliſhment, to aſſiſt him in the diſcovery of his Wife. And indeed he could not have addreſt himſelf better. <hi>Radegond</hi> was own Siſter to <hi>Hugo,</hi> ſhe ſerved the Counteſs by the name of Madam <hi>Valery,</hi> in the quality of a Waiting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman; and the Gentlemans means growing ſmall, and <hi>Valery</hi>'s beginning to leſſen, the young Gentlewoman, his Siſter was forced to make uſe of her own parts for the ſubſiſtence of the Family. It could be no great difficulty therefore for her to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <hi>Don Garcias</hi> the accompliſhment of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; but having heard, and remembred an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky ſtory of the Seamen, who make great vows in a ſtorm, and forget them when they are out of it: She was afraid the Count of <hi>Caſtile</hi> ſhould make but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65131:22"/>little conſcience of breaking with her, when ſhe had no farther obligation upon him than his word. She contented her ſelf to flatter his hopes for the preſent, and then betaking her ſelf to a great Lord of the Court, who had had the firſt fruits of her favour, &amp; for that reaſon protected her upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; ſhe told him her adventure, and the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ſhe was in to be Counteſs of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> Her Protector could not believe (at firſt) one word that ſhe ſaid, and looked upon all as Chimerical; but <hi>Radegond</hi> promiſing to bring him to the ſpeech of <hi>Garcias,</hi> and giving him the ſame Arguments to preſwade him it was true, as ſhe had exacted from the Count for the ſtrengthning of their own faith, he believed her by degrees. His advice was to make the diſcovery of the Counteſs as difficult as ſhe could, he gave her leſſons of Hypocriſie to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the Count, andc pretending himſelf her Uncle, he made <hi>Don Garcias</hi> a Viſit, to draw him to a promiſe under his hand of marrying his Niece, if ſhe brought him to Madam <hi>Valery.</hi> The Count conſented to the conditions without any reſiſtance, as well becauſe it was his real intention at that time, as becauſe he ſuppoſed this Uncle not in a poſture to conſtrain him, if he repented it afterwards. The Uncle diſguiſed himſelf in an ordinary Habit, was followed by none of his Servants, and judging his true Name might fright him from promiſing, he took another more ſuitable to the Quality he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, which <hi>Don Garcias</hi> regarded no more, than if he had been no body at all. <hi>Radegond</hi> finding her ſelf ſo well ſupported, ſhe kept touch with the Count, and that without much trouble; for ſhe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65131:22"/>had no more to do, but to deliver him the Key of Madam <hi>Valery</hi>'s Lodgings. The Husband being very angry, got himſelf conducted by ſeveral Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which he hired: And <hi>Paris</hi> being a Town, where they who have money may do any thing, and the Count having found his Pilgrim and his Wife cloſe in one Bed, he needed but one ſtroke to rid himſelf of both. When he had ſatisfied his vengeance in this manner, I am of opinion he would willingly have had no further buſineſs in <hi>Paris,</hi> than to provide for his return. He began to talk of compounding with <hi>Radegond,</hi> he offered her a ſum of money to diſpenſe, and 'tis generally believed his conſcience would have been much at reſt, could he have prevented the accompliſhment of his Vow. But the pretended Uncle would not admit of any ſuch terms. The thoughts he had of ſeeing one of his Miſtreſſes in the Throne of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> flattered his vanity exceedingly; he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf who he was, and the Count <hi>de Caſtile,</hi> being in no condition in <hi>Paris</hi> to contend with the intereſt of one of the chief men in <hi>France;</hi> he thought if ſufficient that he had been the diſcourſe of all <hi>Spain</hi> by his firſt Marriage, without making himſelf ſo at <hi>Paris</hi> by his ſecond. He married <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degond</hi> as he had promiſed, and the Marriage being ratified, and all the Grandees in <hi>Caſtile</hi> aſſembled, <hi>Radegond</hi> was pronounced Soveraign of <hi>Caſtile</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the the ſame Name her Brother had carried in that Country before. Some may ſay perhaps that <hi>Don Garcias</hi> might have as well have accompliſhed his Vow in the perſon of his old Wife <hi>Iſabel de Verman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois,</hi> as in the perſon of <hi>Radegond.</hi> The Subjects
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65131:23"/>were equally diſpoſed, Harlots they were both, and the repentance of the firſt might as well have been expected, as the converſion of the latter. But this ſecond alliance ſatisfied his revenge more than Madam <hi>Valeries</hi> remorſe, beſides the debauchery of the Counteſs was known in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> whereas <hi>Rade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gond</hi> might paſs there for a Saint. He preſented her to the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> for a great Example of Vertue, for a perſon who abhorring the wickedneſs of her Brothers life, had choſe rather to deliver him up to <hi>Don Garcias</hi> indignation, than to ſee the honour of her Family depraved by ſo ungodly an action: it is ſtrange how the natures of things change, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their different faces. We know none of theſe intrigues, bu by the imprudent diſcovery of ſome perſons concerned: and thoſe perſons appear to us the ſhame of their Sex many times by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence they are charged with, who perhaps are much more diſcreet than they which accuſe them.</p>
                  <p>Love is a nimble Deity, and marches a great way in a little time. From the Territory of <hi>Caſtile</hi> he has brought us into <hi>England</hi> in the time we can read half a ſheet of Paper; from <hi>London</hi> he has re-conveyed us to <hi>Burgos,</hi> and from <hi>Burgos</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> with the ſame expedition, and now he is carrying us out of the middle of <hi>France,</hi> into the Court of the Emperour of the Weſt, without deſiring more time for the Journey, than is requiſite for the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a few lines. In the preceding ſtories he has pleaſed himſelf in triumphing over Marriage, in this he ſides with it, and leaves the ſucceeding pair an everlaſting inſtance of Conſtancy and Vertue.</p>

                  <p>Examples of this kind, I muſt confeſs are rare, yet we are not without ſome, and the Duke and Dutcheſs of <hi>Modena</hi> fall very luckily into my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory for an inſtance. This Duke had for a long time been in Love with the Princeſs of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> Daughter to Duke <hi>Henry,</hi> and Couſin German to <hi>Otho</hi> the Third, at that time Emperour of the Weſt. His paſſion for her had ingaged him to follow <hi>Otho</hi> in all his Wars againſt the <hi>Sarrazins</hi> in <hi>Pouille,</hi> and againſt <hi>Lothaire</hi> (the <hi>French</hi> King) in <hi>Auſtraſia.</hi> Love is a kind of <hi>Proteus,</hi> and aſſumes all ſhapes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion, if it meets with a baſe mind, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Author of all ſorts of baſeneſs; but when it is ſo happy as to meet with a noble, and ſublime inclination, it excites to the greateſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and nothing prompts more to vertue, or makes a man more illuſtrious. This was the Character it had taken in the heart of the young Duke of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena.</hi> The Princeſs of <hi>Bavaria</hi> being the price he had propoſed to himſelf of all his Atchievments, he had done Miracles to deſerve her. For her ſake it
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65131:24"/>was he had fought many Battels, and defended many Towns. The Idea he had of her beauty accompanied him in his greateſt perils, and (conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his Conqueſts, as ſo many ſteps which advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him towards the poſſeſſion of the Princeſs, and alliance with the Emperour) one may ſay, that <hi>Otho</hi> ought more of his Victories to the paſſion of the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> than to the Armies of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or the Conduct of his Generals. So glorious an affection could not but be crowned with glory. The Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> obtained the Princeſs of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> as an acknowledgment from the Emperour. The Imperial Reſidence being at that time at <hi>Aixla Chapelle,</hi> the Marriage was celebrated there, and the new Dutcheſs being well worthy of whatſoever the Duke had done for her; and the Duke on the other ſide as worthy of what Love the young Dutcheſs was capable of, never was Bride and Bridegroom more happy, than the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> and his Princeſs, they expreſt the ſame cares and complacences, as are uſed by the moſt violent Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: they delighted to be near one another, and were never ſeparated but in publick; their Eyes, their actions, their every thing diſcovered the kindneſs of their Hearts; and in a word they loved at that rate, they ſet all perſons a gog who obſerved them. The Empreſs <hi>Mary,</hi> Wife to <hi>Otho,</hi> (who merited as much from him, as the Dutcheſs did from the Duke) not meeting ſo much kindneſs from her Husband, began to envy her felicity. She caſt that Matriage in <hi>Otho</hi>'s diſh upon all occaſions, as an Example he ought to follow, and the reproaches of the good Women, being the worſt way they can
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65131:24"/>take to warm the blood of their Husbands, the Empreſs did but little good upon hers: She plagued him ſo continually with that pattern, that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be inſupportable: In ſhort they lookt upon one another as Judgments ſent down on purpoſe to torment them; and this ſecret abhorrency betwixt Man and Wife, being uſually a preſage of new paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Strangers, the Emperour and Empreſs might on a ſudden have perceived, that unlawful Love builds always upon the ruines of Conjugal. The Empreſs could not ſee the Duke with his own Wife, without diſtrubance; ſhe invented every day ſome new pretence or other to divide them, (not conſidering that little interruptions in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, render our Loves more ardent in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of concernment) ſhe by that means inſenſibly increaſed, what ſhe deſired ſo earneſtly to deſtroy. On the other ſide the Emperor finding the Dutcheſs always alone, becauſe the Empreſs could not live without the Duke, that opportunity compleated that flame, which her Charms had ſcarce kindled before: her firſt Confidence was, acquainting her with the impertinence of the Empreſs; how trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom, how unappeaſable ſhe was, and from thence paſſing in courſe to a ſolemn wiſh, that ſhe was but half ſo well diſpoſed as the Dutcheſs; his deſire ſtruck ſo plauſibly upon his fancy, he could not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards get her off on his thoughts. Had he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that this <hi>extempore</hi> wiſh would have one day grown up to a paſſion, and the Empreſs ſuſpected, that the twittering ſhe had for the Duke, would have made her forget all her obligations to her ſelf; there is no doubt but either of them would have
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65131:25"/>made greater reſiſtance. The Emperour was juſt, honourable, and grateful, and well underſtood his ingagements to the Duke, and the Empreſs was not without her natural inclinations to virtue; but Love ſurpriſed both their Hearts before they were aware, and they diſcovered it not, till he was too ſtrong to be repelled, for when that paſſion has once got poſſeſſion, all the ſtruglings, and all the contentions in the World do but fortifie and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it.</p>

                  <p>The Love of <hi>Otho</hi> for the Dutcheſs, and the Love of <hi>Mary</hi> for the Duke beginning much about a time, it happened they broke out, and were diſcovered near the ſame day.</p>
                  <p>There was about that time a famous Painter at the Emperours Court, who had found out a new way of painting, very rare and ingenious in it ſelf. He uſed neither cloth nor colours, prepared after the old way, his work was not infected with the odour of oyl, which diſcourages ſo many from ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for their Pictures, his Colours were mingled with Water and Gum Arabick, his Canvas, a ſort of Vellam, and without any more Tools, than two or three Chriſtal-ſhells, and a few Pencils he made ſtrokes which were almoſt inviſible, and his Pictures
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65131:25"/>were ſo like, they wanted nothing but ſpeaking, to be the ſame. True it is, he was ſomething long, and for that reaſon as well as the delicacy of his painting, he drew all in little; yet he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſame things in a piece of Parchment of a foot ſquare, as well as another Painter would do in a cloth as big as the life. The Dutcheſs being a great Lover of Arts, would needs ſee this man, and make experiment her ſelf, whether he was as inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, as his reputation publiſht: She made him draw her Picture, but her own alone, being nothing ſo grateful to her, as when joyned with her Dukes; ſhe told the Painter he muſt contrive ſome way or other of putting him into the ſame Vellam. He repreſented her therefore as the Painters Muſe, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon a Bundle of Pencils, with her Marble and Peſtil by her ſide, painting a little Picture with her own hand like a Meddail, wherein ſhe had drawn the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi>'s head. The Portraicture was born up by a <hi>Cupid</hi> with a Garland of flowers about his head; two or three more <hi>Cupids</hi> as it were fluttering about with their wings, pointed to her beauty, and made the Spectators take notice of each feature in ſpight of their teeth, and beſides the Excellence of the Work, which was ſufficiently conſpicuous in either of the Pictures, they had ſo happy a reſemblance to the life, that they were ſcarce to be matcht in all <hi>Europe.</hi> This Picture was carried home to the Dutcheſs at a time the Duke fortuned to be abroad. She ſet it by in his Cloſet till he came in, intending to ſhew it him as ſoon as he returned, &amp; ſome buſineſs having called him into another Room, the Emperour chanced to enter juſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65131:26"/>as ſhe was gone forth: he thought to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of her abſence, and to write ſome piece of <hi>Galanterie,</hi> ſome merry Conceit or other that ſhe might find when ſhe came again; and having opened the Cloſet-door with that deſign, the firſt thing he caſt his eyes upon, was her Picture, he found it the piece, and the beſt deſign of any he had ſeen, and Love having a cuſtom of turning all things to his advantage, he put it into <hi>Otho</hi>'s head to take hold of that opportunity for the declaration of his Love. He had ſeen Pictures in Water-colours before, and knew they were to be defaced, to that end he wet the corner of his Handkerchief with Orange-flower water (which he found by accident upon the Table) rub'd the Picture of the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> quite out, and in the place left theſe Verſes, which he writ with his own hand.</p>

                  <p>As ſoon as he had writ theſe Verſes, he went out, and left word with the Dutcheſſes Women, that he had left ſomething in her Cloſet, that was not to be ſeen by any but her ſelf, and therefore he charged them to let no body go into it till ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. They obſerved his Commands, and the Dutcheſs being come back, they told her what word the Emperour had left. She went immediately into her Cabinet to ſee what it was, and finding her Picture disſigured, ſhe was ſo much concerned,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65131:26"/>ſhe could not get it out of her mind: She believed it might be ſome accident at firſt, but taking it up to look cloſer upon it, ſhe was much ſurprized when ſhe found the Emperours Verſes. Juſt as ſhe was in her aſtoniſhment, the Duke coming ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into her Cloſet, Ha, my dear Lord, ſaid ſhe, I thought to have preſented you with the beſt Picture I ever ſaw, but whilſt I was but ſtept into the next room, ſome body has ſpoiled it: and I am afraid the injury to the Picture is the leaſt of the miſchiefs it gives us juſt occaſion to fear. And having, ſaid ſo, ſhe told him how it had been deſigned, how ſhe had left it in her Cloſet when ſhe went out, and in what condition ſhe found it when ſhe came in. The Duke, knowing the Emperours hand very well, cryed out, What, by conſent! both in one day! this is too much. After which words, he ſtood ſtill for ſome time, overcharged with reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which thronged upon his Spirits, and perhaps troubled he had ſaid ſo much. A Perſon of Honour cannot but bluſh to have confeſſed any overture of Love from a fair Lady, let it be in what manner it will: Inſomuch that the Duke being conſcious of the ſame practice from the Empreſs, had no ſooner let theſe words ſlip, but he wiſht they had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken again; but it was then too late to repent. The Dutcheſs being quick, and apprehenſive, what both? and what conſent do you mean, Sir? ſaid ſhe: have you been ſollicited by the Empreſs, as I have been by the Emperour? The Duke would fain have diſſembled it, and endeavoured to give his words another explication, but perceiving the Dutcheſs could not be put off ſo, and that by her ſilence, ſhe

I had, ſaid he, ſome apprehenſions of it before, but a man of Honour ought not to believe his own ſentiments in ſuch an affair, I obſerved ſhe had great inclinations to my Company, and Diſcourſe, and more than I thought could proceed from a ſimple Civility. She looked upon me (as I fancied) like one that was in Love, and ſhe commended me above the rate of common reſpect; but I had rather give eſteem more than belongs to it, then to grant that to Love which I knew was its due. In this conſideration I waited many times upon the Empreſs upon the leaſt of her Commands, and many times I prevented them, and attended her without; for I had a ſuſpicion, that by denying her paſſion indifferent compliance, I might provoke it to demands more particular, and conſiderable: Upon this ſcore it was I went to her Court this afternoon, as I had done many times before. I found her alone with her Daughters, all of them imployed in ſtringing of Pearl. By mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune a rich Picture-caſe of a very great value, fell out of the lap of one of the young Ladies, as ſhe was riſing to ſalute me, I ran preſently to take it up, and having preſented it to her who let it fall, I was making ſome Complement for the diſorder I put them to: But the Empreſs coming up to me, and whiſpering me in the ear, ſaid, <hi>Keep the Box, my Lord, your power is too great over the Original, not to have the Copy at your abſolute Command.</hi> I open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Caſe, and I found (what I expected) the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65131:29"/>Picture of the Empreſs. I pretended to underſtand her diſcourſe no otherwiſe than as a tryal of my reſpect; and preſenting the Box with great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, No, no, Madam, ſaid I, do not ſuſpect me of Sacriledge, I am ſo Religious an obſerver of my duty, that the very Copy of this Original is too ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred a thing for me. Be not ſo modeſt, replied the Empreſs, and made ſigns to me follow her to the Window. Sometimes it is more criminal to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe favours that are offered, than to force them where they are refuſed; and then her paſſion ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving vanquiſht all oppoſition, the inconſiderate Princeſs told things ſo plain (and her Eyes inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the reſt) that I could have wiſht I had loſt the exerciſe of my ſenſes, that I might not have been privy to a thing ſo derogatory to the Imperial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Modena</hi> heard her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands relation, with a concernment that was viſible in her face, and looking upon him with tears in her Eyes, Ah, my Lord, ſaid ſhe when he had done, I ſee the Heavens do envy my Felicity, I ſhould have been to happy for a mortal Creature, could I have loved you, and been beloved by you without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; but I was not born to ſo much good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and the Empreſs has reaſon to diſturb it. In what is it that the diſturbs it, replied the Duke, ſomething haſtily? have I complied with her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? have I concealed it from you? or do you find I love her better than you? No, Sir, replied the Dutcheſs, and I give you thanks that you have not, but I fear what the Empreſſes Charms were not able to compaſs, the ingratitude of the Emperour may poſſibly procure; you lookt upon that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65131:30"/>as the Wife of your Maſter, and thought it your duty to the goodneſs of <hi>Otho,</hi> to make a generous oppoſition to the infidelity of his Conſort. But alas, now the caſe is alter'd, and the ſame <hi>Otho</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the greateſt of your Enemies, what is there left to ſecure your affection from a young Princeſs, which loves you ſo entirely, and is the firſt perſon of her Sex in the World? Your Charms, Madam, replied the Duke, interrupting her, are ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſo rigorouſly adored by me, that they will infallibly ſecure my faith for your ſelf: Reſt you contented in that, and do not imagine that my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be revenged of the Emperour, obliges me to give him a pretence to take his vengeance on me. The Empreſs would be too dear a purchaſe, if I ſhould gain her by the loſs of you; and you would have reaſon to rejoyce at your loſſes, if I my ſelf ſhould ſhew you the way to repair them. This excellent Pair ſatisfied one another ſo amply againſt all the ſuſpicions that conjuncture repreſented; That <hi>Cupid</hi> knowing well he ſhould not have ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities every day, to make his puiſſance known upon Lovers of their Character, reſolved to make this Example as famous as it was rare. The Duke reſiſted the kindneſs of the Empreſs with ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant a firmneſs, it lookt almoſt like contempt; and the Dutcheſs received all the attapues of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, with the ſame reſolution; but 'tis dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſometimes to puſh things too far. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour made a Treat (one day in a Garden of his not far from the Town) upon the Bank of a River which runs by, it was not long the Trees in it had been planted, nad ſo gove not much ſhade; but
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65131:30"/>that defect was ſupplied by certain Arbours, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes covered over with a ſort of Leaves, which put forth ſooner than ordinary. Part of the Cabanes were made into the form of a Labyrinth, ſome were double, ſome ſingle, and all of ſeveral faſhious. Into one of theſe Cabanes <hi>Otho</hi> had conducted the Dutcheſs of <hi>Modena,</hi> and the Empreſs pretending her ſelf weary, was retired with the Duke (who had the honour to lead her) into another. It is to be ſuppoſed, that neither the one Lover, nor the other would loſe that convenience of complaining of their Deſtiny. The Emperour begged, and ſighed, and perhaps wept: The Empreſs (the more impetuous of the two) when fair words would not do, began to threaten revenge. The coldneſs wherewith the Duke entertained the Empreſs, was more intolerable, than that with which the Dutcheſs received to Empreſs. It is an Honour to a yong Prince to be a Gallant, and an amorous Atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, gains as much reputation ſometimes, as the bloodieſt Victory. But with the Women it is not ſo, a Lady cannot advance one ſtep, but ſhe charges her ſelf with the whole Intrigue; and a repulſe which would be nothing in a Lady to her Servant, becomes an unpardonable indignity in a Servant to his Miſtreſs. The high-ſpirited Empreſs, ſeeing her ſelf rejected by a perſon ſhe had obliged by ſo many favours, conceived ſo great a diſpleaſure, that ſhe could not conceal it. She threatned him with all the miſchiefs an inraged Empreſs could bring upon him, and departing with a geſture importing fury and indignation, ſhe left him to take his choice, whether he would prevent her revenge, or feel the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65131:31"/>effects of it. On the other ſide the Emperour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his paſſion as tedious to the Dutcheſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of having gained any advantage, he left her, and that as ill ſatisfied as the Empreſs with the Duke. They both of them walkt ſome time up and down to diſpel the trouble their diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had brought them; both of them perceived the Duke and Dutcheſs come forth of the Arbors where they had left them, and enter together into another, where they ſuſpected, they retired to give an account to one another what had paſt. This Arbor was one of thoſe that were double, one might ſlip by betwixt the Pillars without being ſeen of thoſe who were either within, or without. An unluckly concurrence of Curioſity excited theſe two Lovers to hide themſelves behind the Curtain, and though <hi>Otho</hi> knew nothing of the Empreſſes Intrigues, and the Empreſs had but a ſlight ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of <hi>Otho</hi>'s, their paſſions carried them (as it were by conſent) to two ſeveral places, from whence (without perceiving one another, or being perceived by any one elſe) they might hear all that was ſpoken. The diſcourſe was very terrible for all four. The Dake and the Duthcheſs underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danger in which the pertinacity of their Perſecutors (as they called them) had placed them, expreſt their apprehenſions in ſuch terms as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the two Eveſdroppers with jealouſie; but when from ſimple Narratives they proceeded to imprecations, what Satyr, what Invective was it, which the Duke beſtowed not on the Empreſs? He called her by the worſt names he could invent, the Dutcheſs making up the Conſort by the ſame
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65131:31"/>Elogies upon the Emperour: They ſpoke with full liberty, for being ignorant of the faſhion in which that Arbour was made, they believed they were to fear no body they did not ſee; beſides the Emperour and Empreſs being gone in a huff, they did not expect that either of them ſhould return. In the mean time the two perſons of whom they diſcourſed ſo liberally, heard every word, and I leave it to the Reader to judge how much they were ſurprized to underſtand ſuch tidings of their affairs. The Emperour had no kindneſs for the Empreſs, and the Empreſs had too much for the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> to care much for him: But Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Jealouſie in their hearts performed the functions of Love. <hi>Otho</hi> could not hear the ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of <hi>Mary</hi> without paſſion, and reſentment: and <hi>Mary</hi> was as impatient that the Dutcheſs ſhould triumph over all the hearts ſhe had intereſt in. She thruſt her ſelf furiouſly out of the place ſhe was hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and perhaps in the firſt motion of her tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, might have run into ſome actions leſs ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her Sex than her deſpair; But the Emperour coming out upon the ſame deſign at the ſame time, they met, and were ſo ſurprized at the ſight of one another, they had no power either to move or to ſpeak. The Duke and the Dutcheſs came out alſo in the nick, and perceiving them in a place where they believed they had heard all they had ſaid, the ſour Lovers repreſented ſuch a Scene of ſilence, as is more eaſie to imagine than expreſs. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour caſt about his furious eyes ſometimes upon the Empreſs, ſometimes upon the Duke, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon the Dutcheſs. The Empreſs (divided
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65131:32"/>betwixt choler and ſhame) changed her colour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variety of her thoughts: and the two innocent Cauſes of all this diſtraction (appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending nothing for themſelves, but each for the other) by the motion of their eyes ſeemed to ſay, they were ready to become Victims to their Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, rather than to fail in the leaſt juſt duty of their Loves. Perſons of their Character and Quality do ſeldom evaporate into unprofitable words; and in theſe kind of occurrences, ſilence is more ſerviceable than Rhetorick. The Emperour withdrew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other intimation of reſentment than by his looks; and the Empreſs following, in great fury and confuſion, all the Court did the ſame. The Feaſt was interrupted in this manner, and very few knew the reaſon: Every one gueſt as his own fancy ſuggeſted, but ſcarce three of the whole Company could hit of the right. Whether the rage was greater in the Emperour or Empreſs, is not eaſily decided: Some are of opinion that their Love commencing at the ſame time, expreſt at the ſame time, and now diſcovered by the ſame accident to one another, their Revenge kept the ſame conſort: But whether it was <hi>Otho</hi> who had a deſire to rid himſelf of a perſon who triumpht over him, in the heart of his Empreſs, or <hi>Mary</hi> (who had a mind to be revenged for the contempt of her kindneſs, and ſo prevent the reproaches of the Emperour, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the object) ſo it was, the Duke was found murdered the night after the Feaſt. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the Murder ſet upon him like Thieves, and demanded his Purſe; but they quickly made it evident it was his life, not his money, they ſought
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65131:32"/>for; for having given him three mortal wounds, they left him expiring upon the ground, without taking his purſe which they demanded, or his Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels which he had in plenty about him. It is not neceſſary to inſert how the fair Widow reſented ſo foul an action. I ſhould have expreſt the affection ſhe had for her Husband but weakly, if the Reader could not imagine the extream ſorrow ſhe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for his death. She doubted not but it was contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Emperour, or the Empreſs, and leſt ſhe ſhould miſtake in the object of her Revenge, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſacrifice them both. I ſhall not mention the means ſhe uſed to accompliſh it, ſuch Tragical Cataſtrophes do not accommodate with Annals of Love; and I ſhall refer the Reader to the Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Hiſtory, to inform himſelf how the Dutcheſs having revenged her ſelf upon the Empreſs, by the reſentment of the Emperour, made uſe of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes Creatures to ſacrifice the Emperour to her Ghoſt. But ſome will ſay, why this inſatiable fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? why doth it not ſtop in the middle of its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer? The Empreſs death was but juſt, and it was no more than the Dutcheſs was obliged to; ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed her of the Murder of her Husband, and if ſhe was not the only Inſtrument of his death, ſhe was the moving Cauſe; for had ſhe not loved the Duke <hi>Otho</hi> had not been bound in honour to have made him away. The Emperour ought not to be comprehended in the Revenge, he might be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent for ought ſhe knew; and if he were guilty, he might have married her, and ranſomed his life. I muſt confeſs this objection is not altogether imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE SECOND PART.</head>
               <p>THE Chronology of Hiſtory not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exactly with the Chronology of Love, there are ſome years in which no amorous Intrigues are to be found, and there are others in which all the conſiderable Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are Love. My Annals containing only matters of Courtſhip, I cannot be ſtrict in the obſervation of Times; but ſhall preſume (upon occaſion) to put the paſſages of the ſame Age, into the Amours of the ſame year, and ſo skip from one Age to another in my Deſcription of Years. I ſhall begin therefore this third Annal, by the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65131:34"/>Reign of a Prince who lived about a hundred years after the Emperour I mentioned before. <hi>Caſtile</hi> being a Country too flouriſhing to continue long under the denomination of a County. <hi>Don Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias Fernandez</hi> (of whom we ſpake in the beginning of our Annals) was the laſt of its Counts. It took the Title of a Kingdom under <hi>Sanchyle Grand,</hi> next Succeſſor to <hi>Garcias Fernandez:</hi> and having paſt in that way, to the time of <hi>Sanchy</hi> III. it devolved by his death to his Brother <hi>Alphonſo</hi> King of <hi>Leon,</hi> who was from that time called King of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> At the beginning of his Reign this Prince was perplext with ſeveral Wars; the <hi>Mores</hi> and the <hi>Sarracens</hi> infeſted him ſo, that he was forced to implore the aid of the King of <hi>Fance</hi> againſt thoſe Enemies of Chriſtianity. Many Knights and Reformades re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to him from all parts. But the <hi>French,</hi> as the more Martial, were moſt kindly received. <hi>Raymond</hi> the Son of <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy, Raymond</hi> Earl of <hi>Toulouſe,</hi> and <hi>Henry Lorraine</hi> Son to <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> Brother to <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> performed ſuch eminent Exploits, that <hi>Alphonſo</hi> believed he could do nothing more for the advantage and ſecurity of his Crown, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thoſe three Captains in the Command of his Armies. He had three Daughters, two of them natural, and the other legitimate. The eldeſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rraca,</hi> he married to <hi>Raymond</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and gave him in Dowry the Principality of <hi>Galicia; Thereſia</hi> (the eldeſt of the two naturals) married <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> and had for her ſhare the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in <hi>Portugal:</hi> and the youngeſt, <hi>Elvira</hi> (much handſomer, and better beloved by her Father than
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65131:34"/>either of the other) was married to <hi>Raymond</hi> of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> with ſecret ingagement from <hi>Alphonſo</hi> to aſſure to him the Kingdoms of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leon,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death. And thus I have given you the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of this year, not ſo eminent for Love, as it promiſed in appearance. Theſe ſix perſons had almoſt no ſooner ſeen one another, but they were married, and no ſoouer married, but they differed, ſo that this place would be more proper for an Hiſtorical Abridgment. than the Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an amorous Intrigue.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>But bold! determine not, Loves ways are ſtrange,</l>
                  <l>He had his private and peculiar Laws.</l>
                  <l>Nothing is ſo remote, but he can change,</l>
                  <l>And bend it to the Model of his Cauſe.</l>

               <p>
                  <hi>Elvira</hi> was ſo obſequious to her Father, and he ſo tranſcendently kind to her, that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rraca</hi> (being his only legitimate Child, and by conſequence had beſt right to that preference) began much to reſent it. She had private advertiſement every day, that <hi>Alphonſo</hi> deſigned the Kingdoms of <hi>Leon</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> for his Daughter <hi>Elvira:</hi> and judging it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that either the Prince her Husband, or her
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65131:35"/>ſelf ſhould be conſtantly about his Majeſty, to have the better eye upon his actions, they conſulted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to reſolve which of the two was moſt proper for the Journey, and it fell to Prince <hi>Raymond.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did <hi>French</hi> man of his Age, and Spirit, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried for intereſt (as he was) refuſe any opportunity of travelling. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rraca</hi> in the mean time continued in <hi>Galicia,</hi> to govern that new Territory in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of her Husband; and the Prince ſet forth for the Court of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> The pretence of his Journey, being a concern for the Kings health, it is eaſie to imagine he was not unwelcome at his Arrival. There was no noiſe but of Entertainments, and Balls. <hi>Raymonds</hi> buſineſs there was not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, he came thither to diſcry, and make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his obſervation. The young <hi>Elvira</hi> was much pleaſed with Divertiſements, and indeed at her age, who is it that hates them? She was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly delighted with thoſe her Brother-on-law gave her, and ſhe wanted neither Civility to invite, nor kindneſs to preſs him to ſtay at that Court as long as he could: And to ſpeak the truth, ſhe had no hard task to perſwade him to ſtay. This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs was one of the greateſt Beauties in the World; <hi>Raymond</hi> had always thought her much handſomer than his Wife: And though <hi>Elvira</hi> had ſcarce ſeen the Prince before he was married, yet ſhe alſo eſteemed him more compleat, than the perſon ſhe married. But Perſons of their Rank, are the leaſt guided by their own inclinations. The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages <hi>Raymond</hi> purpoſed by his Marriage with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raca,</hi> made him prefer her to <hi>Elvira;</hi> and <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi>'s Election happened upon the Count <hi>de Tholouſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:65131:35"/>for his youngeſt. Marriages in this nature do ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſuffer the Husbands, to conſider the vertue of their Wives. Hence it was the Prince of <hi>Galicia</hi> found his Siſter-in-law as charming under the Title Counteſs of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> as he had judged her when ſhe was but <hi>Elvira</hi> of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> Behold them therefore in perfect intelligence, the Counteſs took ſingular ſatisfaction in the Company of the Prince, and the Prince was as much pleaſed with the Commands of te Counteſs. Her Husband the Count of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe,</hi> being of the ſame Nation with the Prince, and not ill acquainted in matters of Love, was the firſt that obſerved the inclinations of the Prince of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia.</hi> He took the Counteſs aſide one day, and after a long enumeration of the ſubtilties and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mankind, he concluded his Harangue with a ſerious admoniſhment to guard her ſelf from the inveiglements of the Prince of <hi>Galicia:</hi> of the Prince of <hi>Galicia?</hi> cryed <hi>Elvira,</hi> in no little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; alas, my Lord, he hath married my Siſter. And becauſe he hath married your Siſter, replied the Count, is he the leſs capable of being your Gallant? Believe me, Madam, theſe kind of relations are no impediment at all, on the contrary, the greatneſs of the ſin gives it many times a <hi>Ragouſt,</hi> and I my ſelf have known ſeveral make Love to their Kindred, who would not have regarded them, had there been no Alliance. The young <hi>Elvira</hi> had been brought up ſo modeſtly, ſhe could not hear the word <hi>Inceſt</hi> without trembling, ſhe would have ſworn there had been no ſuch thing committed in the World, ſince the days of <hi>Lot,</hi> and his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and doubtleſs had the Prince of <hi>Galicia</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:65131:36"/>ſpake half that which her Husband had done, ſhe would not at that time have endured him. But mark the indiſcretion of ſome Husbands, they are many times the Authors of all the miſchief which befals them: and ſome Women are ſo ignorant in thoſe kind of affairs, they would never have known what that Love had meant, had not the reproaches, and impertinent admonitions of their Husbands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them. The Counteſs fixing her eyes upon the Count, with an aſtoniſhment that demonſtrated her innocence: Ha, my Lord, ſaid ſhe, tell me I beſeech you, in what is it you obſerve the Prince of <hi>Galicia</hi> hath ſuch kindneſs for me? I am not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his deſire to oblige me, but I perſwade my ſelf 'tis in conſideration of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rraca,</hi> and I ſee ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle probability that a man ſhould be enamoured of his Wifes Siſter, that <hi>Raymond de Burgogne</hi> might tell me ſo a hundred times, and I deſire to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. He need not tell you once, unleſs you pleaſe your ſelf, Madam, replied the Count, what I have done is but to adviſe you to prevent that declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have a care how you are with him alone, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt him in any diſcourſe you think tending that way, and ſuffer him not to endanger ſo vertuous an innocence. He loves you, Madam, and it is I do aſſure it: do you not diſcern his diligence, how his eye is always upon you, how he crowds and ſteals himſelf cloſe to you in all Aſſemblies, and how he ſighs when he is forced to forſake you? He was ſo inconſiderate the other day before me, that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing what Beauty it was he liked beſt, he had no more wit than to delineate you. The Counteſs had taken no notice of that circumſtance, ſhe was too
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65131:36"/>much a Novice in Love-affairs to apprehend any ſuch thing, but her curioſity kindling at her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands diſcourſe: Why, my Lord, ſaid ſhe, do you call that Love? what hurt is there in that innocent way of diverting the Company? For my part I have always lookt upon Love as a dangerous buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but if all its effects are blemeleſs, as that with which you are ſo highly alarm'd, it is not ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as I did imagine. You do well, Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Count in ſome paſſion, to be no more affected with my admonition, but let me deſire you once more not to depend upon your own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matters of that importance; the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Love as always inconſiderable, but the conſequence of thoſe trifles, are commonly unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate: and then entring upon a long recitation of amorous Adventures, which no man but her Husband durſt have undertaken to have told her, he cloſed up all with ſome Original Examples, and gave her more knowledge by that ſingle Dialogue, than ſhe had gained of her ſelf in ten years expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>

               <p>The amorous Prince of <hi>Galicia</hi> not knowing how officious the Count of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> had been, to give the Counteſs a ſenſe of his affection, attended with impatience all opportunity to let her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what ſhe was already informed of. He found <hi>Elvira</hi> alone many times; by her deportment ſhe ſeemed not to be cruel, nor did he want either Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or Wit; but her little experience in thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs was the thing he principally dreaded; he feared his confidence was not great enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the name of Love, much leſs to commit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt; and therefore not daring to venture a ſecret of that nature to ſo young and ſqueamiſh a perſon, he conſumed himſelf in unprofitable deſires, when on a ſudden his Deſtiny befriended him with an opportunity to accompliſh them: and indeed <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi> ſeldom abandons his Votaries in their extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; when a man hath nothing to do but to ſpeak, the greateſt part of his Adventure is done to his hand. There was about this time an Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger arrived at <hi>Burgos,</hi> or at leaſt a man pretending to be ſo, and ſeveral Miracles were reported of him. Theſe ſort of people in former Ages, being more rare, were more venerable than in ours: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the opinion was, nothing of futurity could be predicted but by Magick: But now a days eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one pretends to it. Our Aſtrologer having ſet up his Bills, and made a large Paneyrick in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his Art, the noiſe he made in the Town, by the means of his Officers, came to the ears of <hi>Alphonſo: Alphonſo</hi> muſt needs ſee him, and amongſt other admirable things which he preſaged, and would anſwer for them upon his head, he ſhew
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65131:37"/>himin a Book the Names of all the Miſtreſſes he had formerly had, and the principal Occurrences in his Amours. He needed no more in the Judgment of the good King to intitle him a Magician: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he forbid his Daughter, and all the reſt of his Court to have any communication with this man, being aſſured what he had ſhown him was more than natural, and looking upon his Book as a piece of <hi>Lucifers</hi> Library, he believed it compoſed by the Devil. The Prince of <hi>Galicia</hi> who did not fancy the Devils ſo ſociable, apprehended not that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for the aſtrologer, as the King would have perſwaded him to. He ſent for him to his Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and having threatned to cut his throat, if he told him not the truth; he promiſed him a conſiderable reward, if he would be ingenuous and diſcover. The Conjuror being frighted with his threats on one ſide, and incouraged with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on the other, confeſt freely to the Prince that he neither underſtood Signs, nor Planets, that he queſtioned, whether any man alive was ſo skilful as to deduce any certain Preſages from them, and that as to his Book, he owed all the reputation of that to a certain Water he made, which covered what he writ when he had a mind to it, and being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the rays of the Sun, went away again it ſelf, and left the Character entire. By the help of this Secret, my Lord, ſaid the Aſtrologer, I write down in my Book whatever I know of any perſons Intrigues. When I have done that, I waſh over what I have writ, with the aforeſaid Compoſition, and then laying it in the Sun, I make it appear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is neceſſary for my Fortune or Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65131:38"/>But, ſaid the Prince, then you but ſeldom hit right, for it is impoſſible you ſhould know all the Intrigues in the World. My Lord, replied the Aſtrologer, I put ſo great a price upon the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my Book, that the Common-people are not able to go ſo high: it is only Soveraign Princes, and Perſons of eminent Quality can reach the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence I require; and for thoſe of that Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, their moſt ſecret Intrigues are known, and ſo it is they come to think my knowledge infallible. The Prince of <hi>Galicia</hi> was very much ſatisfied with the integrity of the Aſtrologer, and inferring from his fidelity in this, he might be truſted in greater matters, he reſolved to make uſe of him for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his paſſion to the Counteſs of <hi>Tholouſe.</hi> He gave him ſo magnificent a Preſent, that he might promiſe himſelf the utmoſt of his aſſiſtance, and paſſing from thence to the Counteſſes Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was ſo fortunate as to find her alone. He began his converſe by the praiſe of the Aſtrologer, proteſted he had told him ſuch things as he could not have learnt but by Miracle, and having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by <hi>Elvira</hi> that ſhe had not ſeen that Prodigy as yet, he offered to attend her to him when ſhe pleaſed to command. Alas, Sir, replied the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>Elvira,</hi> I would willingly accept your offer, but the King is ſo perſwaded of the mans commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the Devil, that he hath injoyned me to the contrary. How injoyned you, Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Prince, is it for a Perſon of your Quality to have any thing forbidden you? were you a Child, or had not the wit or diſcretion which is requiſite at your age, the King might uſe his Authority;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65131:38"/>but for you, Madam, one of the moſt ingenious, and prudent perſons alive, to be interdicted ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different a Curioſity, believe me, Madam, you will deſerve that uſage, if you endure it without regret; and were it not but to inſtruct his Majeſty in what manner you are to be treated, I would perſwade you to ſee this Aſtrologer, and I do not doubt but to juſtifie your diſobedience. This diſcourſe jumpt exceedingly with the vanity of <hi>Elvira,</hi> ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a long time to be rid of <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s Tuition, and have the management of her own Affairs, but ſhe had a habit of awe upon her, that hindred her from ſhaking off the yoke: For ſome time ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the Princes Propoſition. He ſaw well enough ſhe had a deſire to be with him, but ſhe durſt not follow her own inclinations. Sometimes ſhe ſaid ſhe had no faith for ſuch kind of things; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that ſhe had nothing upon her heart, about which ſhe needed to conſult an Aſtrologer; and as the laſt Argument of all, ſhe told him ſhe did not know how far it might diſſatisfie her Husband. He was a paſſionate man, and ſhe durſt not enterpriſe a thing of that importance, without his permiſſion. Upon this Article <hi>Raymond de Burgogne</hi> began to ſhow his Rhetorick. He told <hi>Elvira</hi> that for her Husband to take cognizance of ſuch particular actions, was Tyranny: that Perſons of her Vertue and Quality, were to be left to their own Conduct, and propoſing to her the Example of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rraca,</hi> whom he had left abſolute Miſtreſs both of her own actions, and all his Eſtate, he brought her at length to a reſolution of ſeeing the Aſtrologer: they agreed upon the next day. The King and the Count be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65131:39"/>to give Audience to certain Deputies from <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe,</hi> and that Ceremony being to take them up all that afternoon, the Counteſs had full liberty to ſee the Aſtrologer without danger of ſurprize. The bargain being made in this manner, the Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his Chamber, ſent immediately for his Aſtrologer (which we ſhall call <hi>Abdemelec</hi>) and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received him with a long ſtory, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pretences of kindneſs to him, he told him he had a deſign to put a Trick upon the Counteſs of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and he would intreat his aſſiſtance. The Aſtrologer offered his ſervice freely; he had had too great experience of his liberality, to neglect any occaſion of receiving the fruits of it; he wiſhed with all his heart he was as neceſſary in all the Princes Affairs, and never deſired ſo much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in his profeſſion, as at that time. <hi>Raymond</hi> perceiving him ſo well diſpoſed, perſwaded him that he would pretend Love to his Siſter-in-law, and guilded over his intention with whatever he thought might make it appear innocent. He told him it was by agreement betwixt the Counteſs and he, and that it was to be done upon a Wager. <hi>Abdemelec</hi> underſtood very well what he had to ſuſpect; he had Judgment and Experience, and had ſeldom obſerved a Perſon of any Parts enter upon a deſign, without ſome end or other. He promiſed the Prince therefore to diſcharge himſelf faithfully of his Truſt, he put one of his blank Books into his hands, which the ignorant look upon as a Devil. The Prince writ in it what he deſired the Counteſs ſhould find there, and the Aſtrologer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging to remember the reſt, he left <hi>Raymond</hi> in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65131:39"/>great impatience of receiving the fruits of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance. The Hiſtory doth not mention how he ſlept the night before this declaration was to be, but I dare affirm (&amp; not apprehend to be thought raſh) it was not without interruption. The long wiſht for hour being come, <hi>Raymond</hi> fetcht <hi>Abdemelec</hi> to his Lodgings, and carried him from thence to the Counteſſes Appartment, they ſhut themſelves all three up in her Cloſet, and the Aſtrologer being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his Trade, began to ask <hi>Elvira</hi> about her Nativity; he examined her Phyſiognomy, inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after the principal accidents of her life, and judging he had done enough to give her an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious impreſſion of his skill, he began to produce the Book the Prince of <hi>Galicia</hi> had told her of. <hi>Elvira</hi> trembled as ſoon as ſhe ſaw it, ſhe had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the ſight, and examination of the Conjuror, with very good courage; but when he mentioned the Book of which ſhe had heard ſo many Miracles, and which <hi>Alphonſo</hi> had aſſured her was no leſs than the body of Magick in little, her reſolution began to forſake her. The Prince confirmed her as much as he could, he ſhewed her the leaves of the Book, in which there was no writing to be ſeen. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs having turned them over, the Aſtrologer took it out of her hand, and going aſide to the Window, under pretence of looking out, he laid his Book in the Sun, and having ſtaid there ſome little time, till he judged the heat had exhaled the Water which covered the Writing, he brought the Book open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Counteſs, with the right end upwards, that ſhe might read with more eaſe what was about to be diſcovered. But the poor Lady, affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65131:40"/>to ſee Characters there where but a moment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe was confident there was nothing, ſhe gave a great ſhreek, and inſtead of reading it, threw the Book down, and ran as faſt as ſhe could to the door, to ſave her ſelf from the Devil. The Prince of <hi>Galicia</hi> catcht her by the Gown, and proteſting there was nothing but what was natural in all that ſhe faw, he brought her back (almoſt by force) to a Table where the Book was laid. It was pleaſant to ſee the terrour the poor Counteſs was in: her Curioſity ſcarce made her ſtep one foot towards the Table, but her fear fetcht her as far back again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the door. She put ſuch innocent queſtions to the Prince, and the Aſtrologer, they had no ſmall trouble upon them to keep from blurting in her face. But, good Brother, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Raymond,</hi> what if the reading in this Book ſhould put me into the power of the Devil, and he ſhould fetch me away as ſoon as I had done. Ha, Madam, replied the Prince, he will not fetch you, my life for yours, approach, upon my word: Ha, Sir, replied the Counteſs, your words will do me no good amongſt the evil Spirits, you may give me an hundred before one of them will paſs there. But, Madam, replied the Prince in ſome impatience, hath the Devil carried me away? and yet I have ſeen, and conſulted this Book ſeveral times; do you think he can carry away people as he pleaſes? Alas, he hath not power to carry away thoſe who give themſelves to him, much leſs thoſe who do not. Come, Madam, I beſeech you, and then thruſting her to the Table, in a great fear ſhe read theſe Verſes.</p>

His Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival was ſo unexpected, and his Entrance ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the Aſtrologer had no time to take his Book off the Table. The Count ſnatcht it up immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and caſting his eye upon what he had appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended he ſhould find, he let the Prince of <hi>Galicia</hi> know he was not of an humour to endure ſuch kind of affairs. <hi>Raymond</hi> would have turned all into Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, whilſt the Count was reading, he had had ſome time to recollect himſelf, he endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him, that this declaration of his Love was but an innocent deſign to puniſh <hi>Elvira</hi> for her Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity. But the Count (having ſignified by the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his head, and other geſticulations, he was not to be deluded ſo eaſily) he deſired the Prince very gravely, that he would uſe no ſuch Stratagems for the future; and doubtleſs he had paid the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger for his pains, had he not foreſeen the ſtorm, and prevented it by a timely receſs. The Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was no Fool, he diſcerned by the Princes looks when the Count came in, that this Intrigue was not by conſent, as he had endeavoured to perſwade him. He knew that there was nothing more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary than for little perſons to ſuffer in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of great; ſo that ſlipping away out of the Cabinet while the Count was reading the Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was not to be found afterwards when he was wanting; and indeed I am of opinion he would have ſought all over the Town, to little purpoſe; for after ſuch an accident, he thought it would be too hot: and if in ſuch a caſe any man ſhould ask my advice, I ſhould never conſult the Stars to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to abſcond. From this paſſage of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65131:45"/>Aſtrologer, the Count <hi>de Tholouſe</hi> became ſo jealous of his Wife, that he left her not one moments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. He gave her Lectures every day, he forbid her the moſt innocent Recreations: ſhe could not go one ſtep without Spies. And now let any one that knows the World judge of the efficacy of theſe precautions, and ſay whether they be like to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and reinforce a ſtaggering Vertue. An unjuſt Command is the fountain of diſobedience, and Women never deſire any thing ſo impetuouſly, as what is expreſly forbidden. But it was the Count of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> his Deſtiny, to advance the affairs of the Prince of <hi>Galicia,</hi> which all the Charms and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Raymond</hi> would have attempted in vain. Her deſire of puniſhing the Count for his Jealouſie, put it into her mind to give him occaſion; ſo that this imprudent Husband compleated the felicity of his Wifes Gallant, as he had began it: and as the higheſt effect of the Princes good Fortune. The Count of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> was never ſo well pleaſed with his imaginary preventions, as at the time when his Wife and <hi>Raymond</hi> had illuded them.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65131:46"/>Parties. <hi>Raymond</hi> came many times to a Cloſet-Window, which was no higher than a Buttreſs, and lookt into a private Walk that was much unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented. This Window had an Iron Lettice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, but the Counteſs was ſo cunning, ſhe got a Grate made with Joynts, to be taken down upon occaſion; and this was ſo artificially done, it was not to be perceived. This part of the Palace was ſo ſtrong of it ſelf, it was not thought neceſſary to guard it. <hi>Elvira</hi> went to this Cloſet every night, attended only by one perſon which lighted her, and was well paid for his pains. It was known her cuſtom was to read, when ſhe was there, ſo that her Women were not affrighted, if ſhe ſtaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an hour longer than ordinary. As ſoon as the door was ſhut, ſhe took down the Grate, and receiving the Prince (who leapt plum into the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow without the help of a Ladder) they paſt the time very happily without any diſcovery. Beſides this, they had found another Expedient. There was a Covent of Nuns at <hi>Burgos,</hi> to which the Counteſs made her Viſits very frequently. She carried few of her Friends or Servants with her, pretending unwilling to incommode the young Damoiſells in their Retirement. The Prince of <hi>Galicia</hi> had corrupted the Porter ſo far, as to ſuffer him to enter the Monaſtery in the habit of a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner; he met the Counteſs ſtill in the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure part of the Garden, and it was at theſe Enter-views they agreed where and when they were to meet next. This convenience of private meetings excuſed the Prince from all formal Viſitations; he ſees the Counteſs in publick but very ſeldom, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65131:46"/>the Count of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> judging of their Amours by the frequency of his Viſits, was grown to that paſs he could ſleep pretty well. But nothing is ſo cloſe, but time will diſcover; let one manage his affairs with never ſo much prudence, ſomething or other falls out ſtill to detect it. Upon a night as the Count was paſſing from the King of <hi>Caſtiles</hi> Lodgings, the door of one of the Terraſſes of Communication, being ſhut, he paſt by the private way the Cloſet-Window opened in to; no body but the Count of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> himſelf, durſt have taken that liberty, for that being the uſual Walk for the Counteſs, and her Maids, it was kept as ſacred from all other perſons: as he was going by, the Count perceived a light at the Window, he went ſoftly to it, and commanded his Servants to keep back. By diſaſter the Counteſs opened the Grill at the ſame inſtant to let out the Prince, and obſerving the Flambeau which attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Husband, ſhe not only clapt the Grill to again, but put out her Candle in ſuch haſte, that the great light which was there, and the ſudden putting it out, gave him occaſion to ſuſpect: he ran up di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly into his Wifes Appartment to ſee what was the matter: But he found no Prince, for he had had time to ſave himſelf, but with ſo much precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he left his Gloves behind him. The Count knew at firſt ſight who was their Maſter. He fell into great agonies and imprecations; he cauſed her Lodgings to be ſearcht, and threatned fire and fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots to every one that came near to, and calling for his Flambeau to examine the Lattice; he lookt about it ſo narrowly, that at length he found which way it was to be opened. Had he found his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65131:47"/>in that fury, he had doubtleſs been tranſported to ſome violence againſt her, but ſhe had the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to run immediately to the Kings Chamber; and the fright ſhe was in had produced ſo much compaſſion in the good man, that when the Count followed her with complaints againſt the ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his Daughter, the old King received him with no other Ceremony than threats and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Not liking that kind of Entertainment, he retired ſecretly from <hi>Burgos,</hi> and left his Wife to her Deſtiny. His firſt thoughts were to have gone into <hi>France</hi> to have raiſed Forces there, and to have demanded reparation with his Sword in his hand; but remembring himſelf that he had heard <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rraca</hi> was an imperious and high-ſpirited Princeſs, he conceived ſhe might probably be made ſo ſenſible of her Husbands inſidelity, that ſhe might contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute conſiderably to his Revenge. He took his way therefore towards <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> and indeed to do the Prince of <hi>Galicia</hi> a miſchief, it was the beſt courſe he could ſteer. The Princeſs was of a very ſenſible complexion, the long abſence of the Prince began already to diſturb her. The Count of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe</hi> was a very handſom Perſon, and a <hi>French</hi>-man by birth (which is a Nation ſo acceptable in Foreign parts, that the very name of a <hi>French</hi>-man is enough to ſtartle the ſevereſt of the Ladies, and mollifie the moſt unmalleable obduracy amongſt them. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rraca</hi> no ſooner ſaw her Brother-in-law, the Count, but ſhe felt the force of the <hi>French</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation: ſhe promiſed him whatever he askt; ſhe gave him abſolute Command over the Town of <hi>Compoſtella:</hi> but theſe were but Complements and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65131:47"/>Formalities as yet. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rraca</hi> was not ſo beautiful as <hi>Elvira,</hi> but <hi>Elvira</hi> was the Count of <hi>Tholouſes</hi> Wife, and convict of infidelity. In this poſture were our two Brothers-in-law preparing for repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. <hi>Raymond de Burgogne</hi> lent nothing to the Count of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> but the Count repaid very punctually in <hi>Galicias</hi> and (ſome ſay) with intereſt: for the Intrigue betwixt <hi>Raymond</hi> and <hi>Elvira</hi> being private; nothing was known of it, but what her Husband had been pleaſed to divulge; but that betwixt <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rraca</hi> and the Count was ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick at firſt daſh, there was not any friend the Prince had in <hi>Galicia,</hi> which had not given him adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement. This is an offence in which a man ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conſiders himſelf more than any body elſe: Whether the Wife be beloved, or whether ſhe be not, her inconſtancy is always abominable to her Husband. <hi>Raymond</hi> repairs with all diligence to <hi>Galicia:</hi> He was of opinion he need but ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to diſſipate that ſtorm; but he was miſtaken, and kept out at the Gates of <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> the new Governour ſending him word in a Military way, he had found in the Aſtrologers Book, that he ought to be <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rraca</hi>'s Gallant, as <hi>Raymond</hi> had been Gallant to <hi>Elvira.</hi> It is eaſie to imagine this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement appeared ſomething ſtrange to the Prince of <hi>Galicia:</hi> He was conſcious of having been the Example: but he had kept within the bounds of outward Civility. There was none but the Count knew any thing of his Amours, and he had done his utmoſt to conceal it from him: but to ſee the Gallant of his Wife refuſe him entrance publickly into his own houſe, was a thing he had never ſeen
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65131:48"/>practiſed before. <hi>Raymond</hi> being highly incenſed at the outrage, forgot nothing that might revenge it. He diſpatcht a Meſſenger to <hi>Caſtile,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of King <hi>Alphonſo</hi> poſſeſſion of the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he had promiſed him upon Marriage. He ſent into <hi>France</hi> for Supplies from his Father the Duke of <hi>Bourgondy,</hi> and all the reſt of the Allies. The Count of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> ſeeing him take that way, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his Example; he complained to the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> of the injury he had received by his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He writ to <hi>Lewis le Gros,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> to deſire his Protection. In this manner all <hi>Caſtile</hi> was in an Uproar; The Province of <hi>Galicia,</hi> like to become the Seat of a bloody War, and all, for the impertinence of Love: Love is ſo ſeditious; it works it ſelf into all Plots, and all Parties. No man can tell its power, till he hath tryed it, and no man that hath tryed, is fit to deſcribe it. <hi>Henry de Lorraine</hi> the Husband of <hi>Thereſia</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and Prince of the Conqueſts in <hi>Portugal,</hi> being of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to which life and Generoſity were connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, with great ſorrow underſtood the diſtraction of the Royal Houſe of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> Any body but he would have made his advantage of them: the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the Father againſt two of his Daughters muſt needs be of great importance to the third: But the Princes of his Race, are not capable of ſo mean a thing as private intereſt. He departed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> immediately, went directly to his Father-in-law the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and undertook to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate betwixt his two Brothers-in-law. But for as much as new Acquiſitions are more tottering and uncertain than what are anciently eſtabliſht. <hi>Henry</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:65131:48"/>apprehending his abſence might give opportunity to new Commotions, he kept his Journey very cloſe, and leaving <hi>Fernandez Paw,</hi> a <hi>Portugal,</hi> to aſſiſt his Wife in the Government of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he departed ſo ſuddenly for <hi>Caſtile,</hi> that <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſia</hi> had ſcarce time to write two lines to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But for the making the occurrences at <hi>Caſtile</hi> (at the Arrival of Prince <hi>Henry</hi>) perſpicuous, it will not be amiſs if we inſert what paſſed in <hi>Portugal</hi> before he ſet out. This <hi>Fernandez Paw</hi> (whom he had left chief Counſellor to the Princeſs in his abſence) had long ſince poſſeſt himſelf of that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in her heart. <hi>Henry</hi> was a young Prince more enamoured of the Quality, than the Perſon of <hi>Thereſia.</hi> This <hi>Paw</hi> admired her for both; and it is a great ſatisfaction to a Woman to have her Dominion founded upon her own Excellence. <hi>Paw</hi> therefore had got an intimacy with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs upon that ſcore; and having managed it very diſcreetly, Prince <hi>Henry</hi> had gotten no notice of it. <hi>Paw</hi> ſerved his Prince ſo well in his Foreign Affairs, he was not the leaſt ſuſpected at home. <hi>Thereſia</hi> carried herſelf with as much modeſty as could be expected; but by misfortune, the day before <hi>Henry</hi> was to depart, there had been ſome Letters paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Thereſia</hi> and <hi>Paw:</hi> the Princeſs was ſubject to ſome Chriſtian reflexions, which had put her Gallant into ſome confuſion. He had writ to her upon that ſubject, and <hi>Thereſia</hi> was ſo preſt by her Husband to cloſe up her Pacquet to <hi>Caſtile,</hi> that ſhe ſealed up <hi>Paws</hi> Letter inſtead of one to her Father. This miſtake was not diſcovered till three or four hours after the Prince was departed. They had
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65131:49"/>been imployed all that time in inſtructions <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con.</hi> But when the Princeſs was alone, and had a mind to read <hi>Paws</hi> Letter, which ſhe believed ſhe had left ſealed upon the Table, ſhe was much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to find the Letter ſhe had writ to her Father <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> in its place. That ſhe ſigh't, and wept, and tore her hair, is no great difficulty to imagine. Nothing could ſerve, but ſhe muſt dye, <hi>Fernandez</hi> could not comfort her, and to ſpeak truth, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wanted no little conſolation: But there was no remedy but patience. The Example of her other Siſters gave his ſome relaxation, ſhe could not do worſe, than they had done before her. In the mean time <hi>Henry</hi> arrived at <hi>Burgos,</hi> with <hi>Paws</hi> Letter, inſtead of his Fathers. The good <hi>Alphonſo</hi> was much revived at the ſight of his dear Son-in-law; and looking now upon <hi>Thereſia</hi> as the ſole Inheritrix of that Love, of which <hi>Elvira</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> had rendred themſelves unworthy, he obſerved the tears drop down his venerable Cheeks at the ſight of the Letter the Prince preſented him from her. He opened the Pacquet with great joy, and ſuppoſing there was nothing in the heart of his Daughter, to which her Husband might not be privy, he began to read it aloud; but recollecting immediately that it was not <hi>Thereſia</hi>'s hand, he ſtopt at the firſt line, and then looking upon the Superſcription to ſee how it was directed, he found it, <hi>For the King of Caſtile:</hi> and that the Superſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption was written by <hi>Thereſia</hi> her ſelf; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded then that ſhe might have ſome reaſons (which he did not know) to make uſe of a Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and then ſtepping to the Window, he read
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65131:49"/>theſe Lines, which (to accommodate our ſelves to all ſorts of Readers) we have taken the pains to tranſlate our of <hi>Spaniſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ah, my dear Princeſs, how inſupportable are you grown with your remorſes! have I not told you a thouſand times, that there is nothing owing to Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, but the conſervation of their Honours? That the great diſcretion lyes in chuſing a friend, who by the prudenee of his Conduct, would keep them from ſcandal: and theſe Formalities being obſerved, there is no more due from you to Prince</hi> Henry. <hi>Courage, Madam, overcome this unſeaſonable compunction; and that it may be nipt in the bud, permit that I may wait upon you this night with new Arguments againſt it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Never was any man ſo ſurprized as <hi>Alphonſo</hi> at the reading of this Letter. It was to be his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cuſtom to ſee his Daughters diſloyal. <hi>Elvira</hi> had taken that liberty in private, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rraca</hi> did it publickly, and the old King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> was ſo good a Father as to impute all to the imprudence of his Sons-in-law. He could not believe it was their temperament, or natural inclination which diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to ſo unnatural actions. The one was debaucht by the Jealouſie of her Husband; the other by her deſire of Revenge: but for <hi>Thereſia,</hi> he had nothing to ſay in her defence. <hi>Henry</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht in himſelf, he had ſetled the <hi>French</hi> oeconomy in his Family, and <hi>Thereſia</hi> lived at <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> as ſhe would have done at <hi>Paris:</hi> He was liberal, frank, and faithful, ſo that <hi>Alphonſo</hi> was ſo much tranſported at the injury done to this
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65131:50"/>Prince, that he could not maſter his firſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. However it had been but prudence in him to conceal the exorbitance of his Daughter, but the good man was ſo tranſported with choler, that he threw the Letter upon the ground, caſt up his eyes to heaven as a perſon under ſome eminent affliction; and anſwering his own thoughts as it had been his Daughter, he cryed out, You ſhall dye, unhappy Child, you ſhall dye: if your Husband ſhould be ſo merciful to forgive you, I would tear you in pieces with mine own trembling hands, rather than your infidelity ſhould go unpuniſht. The Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi> had like to have ſwounded at this tranſport, he could not conceive the Contents of the Letter, nor the cauſe of <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s diſorder; and asking him (in his ſurpriſe) what infidelity it was he charged upon <hi>Thereſia,</hi> the King took up the Letter again, and delivering it into his hand, here, ſays he, ſee what reaſon I have to be diſturbed, and confeſs I have brought Monſters, not Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, into the World. <hi>Henry</hi> took <hi>Paws</hi> Letter from the King, he knew the hand, and reading it half out, was ſo aſtoniſht at the Contents, he could ſcarce tell whether he was waking, or aſleep. His converſation in the World had not been ſo ſmall, but he knew a Womans vertue was not to be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted without good counter-ſecurity. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Sex by experience, and was not ignorant that the beſt friends are uſually they which diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Husband. But to conſider that he ſhould be the Porter of that unfortunate Letter, was a Pill he could not ſwallow, nor digeſt. His misfortune was too common to be incredible, but the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65131:50"/>with which it was accompanied, was beyond all belief: and it was not ſo much <hi>Paws</hi> Letter that affected him, as that it was his Deſtincy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it. This conſideration ſtownded him for ſome time, and the tranſportation of his Father-in-law, added fuel to his fire; but at laſt the ſtorm was blown over. In that Age (as it is in this) the Tilte of Cuckold was ſo common, it was ſcarce any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be ſo. The diſgrace lyes only where it is known: when a Womans inconſtancy is publick, nothing is greater diſhonour to her Husband: where it is managed with ſecrecy, nothing is ſo tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial. <hi>Henry</hi> lookt upon it as no point of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to publiſh the infirmities of his Wife, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave himſelf ſome few days to digeſt his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment. But the Examples of his Brother-in-law having learnt him ſome Wit, he came one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Kings Chamber, and ſaid to him, You ſee, Sir, by the Letter I have brought you, that your Daughters have no reaſon to upbraid one another. They were born under the ſame Conſtellation, and if any thing diſcriminated me from the Prince of <hi>Galicia,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> it is this, that their unhappineſs is known, and mine is a ſecret. I have no inclination to publiſh it, and if you pleaſe you may conceal the Letter you ſhewed me: Send word to your Daughter that you kept it from me, and I will never convince her of her errour. In giving me <hi>Thereſia,</hi> your Majeſty gave me alſo a Province, which I hope in time to improve into a Kingdom. I have Children already which may ſucceed me hereafter. There is no neceſſity the <hi>Portugals</hi> ſhould ſuſpect whether they be mine, or
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65131:51"/>
                     <hi>Paws.</hi> Conceal the diſhonour of your Daughter with as much care as I, and by the Example of your Family we will demonſtrate, that it is the diſcretion of the Husbands which makes the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Women which are prudent in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and thoſe which are really irregular. The King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> took this Propoſition very kindly. He began to repent himſelf of what he had done, inſomuch that magnifying the Generoſity he had expreſt, he ſeconded his Counſels with ſeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and moſt irrefragable Arguments: and the troubles in <hi>Caſtile</hi> being appeaſed by the death of the Count of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and the interpoſtion of the King of <hi>France, Henry</hi> returned into <hi>Portugal,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mark or token of that he knew. The truth is, he found out a pretence to ſend <hi>Paw</hi> out of the World, and I have been told he had another to make his Wife more obſequious for the future. But (as he preſaged very judiciouſly) his Poſterity have reigned ſeveral years in <hi>Portugal,</hi> whereas the younger Sons of the Royal Family of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> have always diſputed the Crown with the Children of <hi>Vrraca.</hi>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65131:51"/>Hiſtory is ſo fertile in amourous accidnets, ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies us with variety. About the ſame time while things were in this agitation in <hi>Spain,</hi> Love (which had laid about him ſo in the Royal Family of <hi>Caſtile</hi>) was not idle in the Court of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Weſt. This Empire was then under the Dominion of <hi>Frderick Barberoſſa,</hi> a valiant and ambitious Prince. He had ſignalized the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Reign by remarkable Victories, ſo that there was nothing diſcourſed of in all <hi>Europe</hi> ſo much as his Power and Greatneſs. He kept his ordinary Reſidence in <hi>Rome,</hi> as well becauſe the Climate agreed with his body, as upon certain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Deſigns he had upon the Lands of the Church: and becauſe his remoteneſs from the heart of his Empire, cauſed him to apprehend ſome Mutiny in the Towns of <hi>Germany,</hi> he obliged Prince <hi>Henry</hi> (his Son) to continue in that Province the greateſt part of the year. This young Prince was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hopeful; the people of the Empire loved him entirely: So that his Father conceiving ſome Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie louſie thereupon, took the pretence of his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to recal him to <hi>Rome.</hi> They paſt the Winter very lovingly together; and the Emperour having a mind to pry into the Conduct of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third (who was then Pope, and in poſſeſſion oſ the Patrimony of S. <hi>Peter</hi>) he ordered his Son to viſit him frequently. The Prince, in obedience to his Father, waited upon him as often as he was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. He attended him in all his devitions, and among other places to a Monaſtery of Nuns where his Holineſs had a Niece he loved moſt entirely: She was deſcended from the Blood Royal of <hi>Si ily,</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:65131:52"/>and her Uncle the Diſpoſer of all Eccleſiatical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments; but as yet ſhe was not of, years to be an Abbeſs, and therefore at <hi>Rome</hi> was known by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name but Madam <hi>Gonſtance.</hi> She was as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom as was poſſible to wiſh, and beſides ſeveral other good qualities ſhe had a good voice, and ſung incomparably well: at one of the Solemnities of that Covent the Prince heard her one day; and being a great Lover of Muſick, he had a great am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to ſee her; the dignity of her relation to the Pope authorizing his deſire, he askt leave to ſee <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> when the Ceremony was ended. He was much tranſported at the ſight of her, and had never ſeen ſo many graces in one Aſſembly before. Till that day, he was free, his ſoul was his own; and he ſeemed born for <hi>Mars</hi>'s (not <hi>Venus</hi>) Wars. But he was not the firſt man hath become a Captive to the ſimplicity of a Nun. There is a ſort of people not to be captivated but in this ſhape, and there have been Letters ſeen in our days which have taught us, that of all people in the World, none make Love with that confidence and freedom as the Nuns. The Monaſtical Gallantry hath its Laws and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks apart. There are no elegant Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, no Aſſiduities, nor publick Attendances, all things within the Cloiſter are ſo carried privately and with diſcretion; nevertheleſs their Religious Civility is ſo great, they will not diſcourage any mans affection, and there is but few which attempt them, but they arrive at their deſigns. The Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Prince was a handſom Perſon, and a fine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; <hi>Conſtance</hi> had taken a Monaſtick life upon her, more in obedience than choice, and in vows of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65131:52"/>this Nature, there is ſomething always reſerved to direct the intention: Thus have we brought them into <hi>Cupids</hi> High-way. The Prince ſeconded his firſt Viſit with another, and loſt no opportunity of multiplying them: the more he ſaw, the more he admired her; and <hi>Conſtance</hi> was no leſs taken with him: The Prince ſpoke, <hi>Conſtance</hi> attended. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> ſuſpected, the Prince proteſted; and in ſhort, all Formalities being obſerved on both ſides, the Prince perſwaded her he loved her, and was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded himſelf that ſhe loved him no leſs. The Policy of the Grate confining the Princes Viſits to certain and regular hours which his paſſion could not brook; he wanted ſome way of ſeeing <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> when he pleaſed, and that was not eaſie to find. <hi>Conſtance</hi> was very conformable, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not permitting any Abbeſs of Quality (who would perhaps have known better things) there was a moſt ſevere old Governeſs who would truſt no body but her ſelf with the keeping of her Hock: The keys of the doors ſhe brought up her ſelf every night, and laid them in her Chamber. But what is it which Love cannot do? Love is the Father of Invention, and when a Lover has no more to do but to lull the numerous Eyes of <hi>Argus</hi> into a ſleep, he thinks it a trifle, and performable with eaſe. Prince <hi>Henry</hi> judging of the inclinations of the reſt, by what he had experimented in <hi>Conſtance,</hi> reſolved to inſinuate with ſuch of her Aſſociats, as he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved might be uſeful to his deſigns. He ſelected ſuch of the young Cavaliers of his Train as were beſt affected to his intereſt, and moſt like to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate with the Nuns; and gave them in charge to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65131:53"/>make Courtſhip to her that kept the Gate, her that was appointed to be preſent at all diſcourſes, and another whoſe Office it was to rouze the Siſters in the morning. The Enterpriſe ſucceeded as was deſired, and the Gentlemen gained upon them ſo, that by their mediation the Prince had all the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he could wiſh. She which was to attend their Diſcourſes, reported nothing to the Governeſs but Dialongues of Vertue and Piety. The Siſter which was to awake them, did it as ſhe was directed, and ſhe that kept the Gates was ſo favourable, as to give them the impreſſion in Wax of all the Keys in the Houſe: By theſe impreſſions the Prince cauſed new Keys to be made, and whilſt the rigid old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron preſuming upon her own providence, was ſleeping quietly in her bed, the Prince and his three Confidents paſt away whole nights with the four Nuns in the Garden: And there was this very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in their Society, that the Nuns were all of them true to their Camarade, leſt they in revenge ſhould be otherwiſe to them.</p>

                  <p>The deſire of things forbidden is an irregularity of Nature, which knows no bounds but exceſs, the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65131:53"/>reſpect and deference we bear to it, renders it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable; and it is commonly ſeen, the firſt ſtep one makes towards things which are unlawful, is not long before it is followed by the laſt. Our Nuns were grown to that paſs, they were not ſatisfied to manage their Loves within the Walls of the Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to reveive and entertain their Gallants in the Garden, and to wait upon them out again a good way beyond the Gate; but their temptation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the pleaſure they found in it. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of the Emperour was to be celebrated with ſo many fine Spectacles, that the noiſe of the prepartation was got into their Covent. They were taken with a Curioſity of ſeeing one or other of them. The heat which is commonly extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in <hi>Rome,</hi> had obliged the Emperour to make choice of the night for the greateſt part of ther So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity; and the cuſtom of going vailed having bin long uſed in <hi>Italy, Conſtance</hi> and her Companions could ſee no great difficulty in ſatisfying their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. They communicated with the Prince, and he oppoſed not their deſigns. The more a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man tranſgreſſes the Laws of Civility, the fewer ſcruples and impediments a man hath to encounter. For the accompliſhment of this Enterpriſe, he pitcht upon a night in which the Emperour gave an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in a Garden upon the Banks of the River <hi>Tiber:</hi> and <hi>Frederick</hi> having contuived a new way of Divertiſement, reſolved to appear in Maſquerade, and no perſons were to be admitted, but ſuch as were in Diſguiſe. Price <hi>Henry</hi> cauſed Maſuerade Cloaths to be made for <hi>Conſtance</hi> and her Camarades; he furniſht them with a Foreign
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65131:54"/>Equipage, and (committing them to the Conduct. of him who was Gallant to her which kept the Gates) took order for their entrance, and places in the Garden. They arrived without any accident; the perſon appointed to conduct them, attended in an unknown Coach at the Back-gate of their Covent, with Habits proper for their Diſguiſe. The Ladies dreſt themſelves by the way, and left their own Cloaths in the Coach; they entred into the Garden, and placed themſelves. The Prince ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them as Strangers, but whether that Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made them more remarkalbe, or the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Beauty of <hi>Conſtance</hi> pierced thorough her Diſguiſe, ſhe was ſcarce entred into the Garden, but the Emperour perceived her, and had the curioſity to inquire who ſhe was. Either they could not, or they would not inform him; ſo that deſiring to diſcover her by her voice, he accoſted her, and fell into a diſcourſe. The Prince told her which was the Emperour, as ſoon as ſhe came in: So that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Diſguiſe, <hi>Conſtance</hi> underſtood how ſhe was to depart her ſelf. At firſt their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was about indifferent things, the Emperour commended the fancy and neatneſs of her Habit, and <hi>Conſtance</hi> magnified the magnificence of his: But their converſation increaſing inſenſibly, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> (who underſtood the Emperours affairs bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he did hers) gave him ſo many pungent and ingenious anſwers, that augmented his deſire of knowing who ſhe was. He conjured her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foe to ſatisfie him in that point, but her reply was ſo ambiguous, he might believe ſhe was of any good Family in <hi>Rome,</hi> and not know of which:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65131:54"/>And at laſt obſerving the Emperour to perſiſt in his obſtinacy, and fearing leſt he ſhould cauſe her to be dogg'd home to her Covent, or find out ſome other way to ſatisfie his curioſity, ſhe promiſed the next day to give him a meeting in a Garden (which ſhe knew not but by the name) where the Ladies of Pleaſtance did uſually walk. She thought that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance would make the Emperour believe that ſhe which ſpake to him was a Lady oſ that Rank, and ſo thinking her unworthy of his Company, leave her to her ſelf, but it fell out quite contrary. <hi>Frederick</hi> indeed judged of her as ſhe had preſaged, but that opinion made his deſires more violent: for finding them accompanied with hopes, from their conception, he gave himſelf wholly up to them without either fear or diſcretion; he conſidered <hi>Conſtance</hi> afreſh, her ſhape, her air, the ſound of her voice, the quickneſs of her Eye, and the Pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Wit: All of them were as charming in appearance, as they were in effect: and flattering his imagination with a thouſand fantaſtical Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's, he took his leave of her, the moſt enamoured Perſon in the World. Prince <hi>Henry</hi> diſcovered this new paſſion at the very firſt: he obſerved the Emperour ſtick to her, as he had been retained by Inchantment. He bad the Courtiers (eſpecially his Favourites) to take notice of that Lady, of her Preſence, and <hi>bonne Mine,</hi> and believing her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Prince, he called him to him two or three times, to inquire his opinion about her. The Prince was at firſt well pleaſed with his Curioſity, but conſidering the violence of his Fathers humour better, he apprehended what might follow. He
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65131:55"/>made ſigns to the Conducter of the Maſquerades to retire with them immediately, and he being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent enough, took his direction, and making uſe of an opportunity when the Emperour was ſpeaking to a <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour which was there, and juſt come into the Garden: he withdrew <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> out of the Crowd, and re-conducted her to her Covent. All the time they were paſſing in the Coach betwixt the Garden and the Nunnery, they imployed in changing their Habits, as they had done as they came. They were juſt got to the Gate they were to go in at, when day began to break (as if it had attended their coming back, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it durſt appear) but who could imagine the misfortune that befel them? She of the Party which carried the Key, had been ſo much taken up with the contemplation of what ſhe had ſeen, that ſhe had forgot where ſhe had laid it. She examined her Gallants Habit, and ſhe examined her Religious, gropt up and down the Coach, turned over her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, but no Key: The hour they riſe in the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery approached. The people which brought Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to the Market began to appear in the ſtreets: and not one of the poor Siſters could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine by what Miracle they ſhould be conveyed out of the Coach where they were, into the Cells where they ought to have been. No wonder if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked their good Genius, and made millions of promiſes never to run themſelves into the like er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour again. There was not a Saint, nor a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor belonging to their Covent, but they promiſed a Wax-canle, though by the tediouſneſs of their delivery, they did not ſeem to be accepted: But at length
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65131:55"/>length their Deſtiny was merciful, and their Key found in the fold of her ſleeve, where ſhe had put it her ſelf, and where (according to the common accident in ſuch caſes) ſhe had ſearcht twenty times, and could not find it. They gave great thanks for ſo ſeaſonalbe a diſcovery; they opened the Gates as eaſily as they could, and ſtole to their Quarters without any noiſe; and in the morning one was troubled with the Colick, another with the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, every one had her diſtemper, to excuſe their lying in bed the next day. The Emperour in the mean time (preſt by his curioſity) was as impatient till the hour oſ the <hi>Rendez-vous</hi> came, as ſhe was indifferent. He got up earlier in the morning, than his ſetting up the night before did ſeem to permit, but all that time he could take no reſt, though <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> ſlept very ſweetly. Scarce was the heat of the day over, but the Emperour was at his aſſignation: he took ſome turns about the Garden, before the Ladies which were uſed to walk there, could get into a condition to appear; but at length the walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hour approaching, he ſee four or five the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt Courtiſans in <hi>Rome</hi> enter, amongſt whom he imagined his unknown Miſtreſs was one. He accoſted them, and laid her particularly aboard with a Complement upon her good Air, her excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Shape, and the Majeſty of her Walk. The Damoiſel was mighty well pleaſed with his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſhe bridled, ſhe ſtrutted, and ſtrained as much as was poſſible to deſerve it; ſhe bit her lips to make them look red, and put her Eyes into the beſt poſture ſhe could: but ſhe might have let them alone as well. The Emperour found his miſtake,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65131:56"/>and that ſhe had neither the Shape, Eyes, nor Voice which he lookt for. The converſation of this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was tedious to him, when he compared her with <hi>Conſtance:</hi> and ſo leaving, and throwing his eyes up and down the Garden, he continued there till night, but no Nun, nor no body to ſupply the place ſhe had gotten in his heart. This diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment went very near him; he could not think of it without indignation, and his Choler fermenting with his Love, he retired into his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace ſo agitated, and diſturbed, one would have thought he had been to fight ſome great Battel, or had the Conqueſt of all <hi>Turkey</hi> in his head. Whilſt he was conſuming in his Melancholy, and fruitleſs deſires, the Prince and <hi>Conſtance</hi> did but laugh at his miſery: he underſtood by the perſon he ſent home with them, of the meeting ſhe had appointed with <hi>Frederick,</hi> and of her reſolution to fail: and being told that afternoon by ſome of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Servants, that the Emperour was gone into the Walks: He thought that a fit opportunity to viſit the Popes Niece, to ſee how ſhe liked the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificence of the Solemnity ſhe had ſeen, and to droll with her about the Emperours credulity. Thus we may ſee the advantage youth hath over age, and how ſucceſsful a man is like to be in his Career, when his own Son runs againſt him. The abuſed <hi>Frederick</hi> having to the motions of a violent curioſity, added the impulſes of ſhame and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his life became ſo uneaſie, and melancholy, he was ſcarce to be known. He went from Church to Church, from one Company to another, ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a perſon he did not know when he ſaw, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65131:56"/>inquiring after one whoſe name he could not tell. Thoſe who pretend great penetration into matters of Policy, attribute that to the Ambition of this Prince, which was indeed due to his Love. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet air which was viſible in his Countenance, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſome ſecret deſign. The frequent Viſits he made (in queſt of his Miſtreſs) to the chief Families in <hi>Rome,</hi> preſaged ſome fatal Revolution in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical State. Thoſe who where faithful to his Holineſs, ceaſed not to put him in mind of the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulency of <hi>Fredericks</hi> Spirit, and that he had ſome evil deſigns or other in his head, which unleſs care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prevented, would be mature immediately. Upon which ad vertiſement, <hi>Siena</hi> (as a Town like to be the firſt object of his Ambition) was fortified forthwith: all his Holineſſes Troops had order to march down towards <hi>Milan,</hi> which was lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as inclining to the Emperour. The Emperour having notice of what paſt, thought it high time to look to himſelf. His new Love had laid his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition aſleep, but his anger had waked it again; and therefore it was neceſſary he ſhould do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to divert his imagination from the Object that affected him. He drew together what Troops he had in <hi>Italy,</hi> and quarter'd them as cloſe as the Country would bear. To excuſe theſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, he pretended a neceſſity of relieveing <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> his near Kinſman and Ally, againſt the <hi>Polander,</hi> who was become jealous of his Kingdom. In the Imperial Court nothing was talkt of but Muſters and Preparations for War. Prince <hi>Henry</hi> (who by his imployments, was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from viſiting <hi>Conſtance</hi> as he had been uſed,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65131:57"/>and who foreſeeing the Emperours Affairs, muſt of neceſſity ſend him packing into <hi>Germany</hi>) began to ſuſpect his Father might make ſome advantage of his abſence, and ſignified his apprehenſions by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to his moſt incomparable Nun. Having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved one day in one of her Anſwers, a Curioſity to know what the Emperour thought of his, it ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up Jealouſie, and not able to ſatisfie her in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, being to draw ſome Troops ſome few miles from <hi>Rome;</hi> he ſent her his Anſwer in a Letter. <hi>Conſtance</hi> had no paper ready to return him an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and the Princes Meſſenger preſſing her to write, becauſe his Maſter requeſted it; ſhe did it, and writ her mind in the blancks betwixt the Lines of his Letter, and then ſealing it up, ſent it back again to the Prince, containing both the Letter and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. The Prince was on Horſe-back when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, and the Preſence of the Emperour not allowing him time to read it, he put it up (as he thought) ſafe in his Pocket. But whether the trouble which was upon him, hindred him from putting it right in, or that it was the inevitable Deſtiny of all Lovers to have their Secrets diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Letters; this from <hi>Conſtance</hi> fell down, and was obſerved by the Emperour: he made ſigns to one of his Servants to take it up, and give it to him; and was mightily well pleaſed, that it was in his power to underſtand any of his Sons affairs, he opened it as ſoon as he was got where he might do it ſecretly. He was ſurpriſed at firſt to ſee the two different hands, he could not imagine the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that Novelty: but at laſt perceiving one of them to be the Princes, he began with that, and found theſe words expreſt therein.</p>

                  <p>This Letter opened the Emperours eyes, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived clearly now, that he was the man, and knowing within himſelf, that he had not had any
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65131:58"/>Frolick with a Lady for ſeveral years, beſides what paſt lately with the Lady in Maſcarade; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it muſt be there, and that his Son was his Rival. It would be a hard thing to determine which was moſt violent in his ſoul, the pleaſure he conceived at the news of the unknown Lady, or his diſpleaſure to find his Son was like to be his Rival. His firſt reſolution was to ſend immediately for his Son, to conjure him to tell him where ſhe lived, and her name, and afterwards to forbid him any Converſe with her for the future, under pain of his indignation. But judging upon ſecond thoughts, that in affairs of any ſtanding, or ſettlement, open reſiſtence doth commonly more miſchief than good: he altered his mind, and concluded the beſt way to try what might be done by artifice before he came to violence. He ſet Spies upon his Son, he underſtood he went abroad every night, he imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people to dog him, and at leagth diſcovered he went into the Covent to <hi>Conſtance:</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the diſcovery, he ſaw another Letter of hers (under the ſame hand) lying upon the Popes Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to whom ſhe had addreſt it. He knew the hand was the ſame with the Ticket he had. From whence he inferred, that <hi>Conſtance</hi> muſt needs be his Sons miſtreſs, but he was not certain ſhe was the diſguiſed Lady. The dignity of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of her Vertue in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Profeſſion ſhe had embraced, all theſe, I ſay, agreed ſo little with her being in Maſcarade, that he had no ſooner formed a ſuſpicion of what was too true, but theſe reaſons confuted it: At leagth conſidering with himſelf, that a Nun when ſhe forgets the Religious
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65131:58"/>duties of her Profeſſion ſo far as to love a man more than ſhe ought, ſhe might as well forget her ſelf quite, and ſee ſpectacles as well as other people. He thought <hi>Conſtance</hi> had nor perhaps found ſo much difficulty to accommodate her Diſguiſe with her Profeſſion, as he had himſelf. He called for his Coach, and away he went to her to the Covent to conſult the opinion of his own ſenſes in ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary an Intrigue, and ſcarce had <hi>Conſtance</hi> opened her mough to give him thanks for that honour, but he found it was the ſame voice he had heard in his Dialogue with the diſguiſed Lady; he peept tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row her Habit, and obſerved the ſame ſhape, and Majeſty, which had ſo far tranſported him at the Maſque. Her Eyes had the ſame fire, with which the Heart of <hi>Frederick</hi> was inflamed; and though her Monaſtical modeſty would not permit her to uſe the ſame Wit and Vivacity as ſhe had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet he found ſhe had the ſame quickneſs of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion as then. He had ſeen her ſeveral times at the Ceremonies of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> he knew ſhe was handſom, and ſung very well, but looking upon her as a Religious, whoſe Talent was to be lockt up from the World, he did not trouble himſelf ſo far as to conſider each particular of her Graces. See him then at this time the moſt loving, and the moſt jealous Creature alive. Love in a young man, is but a youthful effloreſcence, which reaſon and time tempers by degrees: But when it ſeizes upon a man that ought to have more wit, when ſetled and experienced, reaſon is not able to oppoſe it ſelf againſt its firſt impulſe, time doth but increaſe it; for never was any man cured of a folly which took
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65131:59"/>him at an age when other people grow wiſe. This firſt Converſation of the Emperour, was only about indifferent things, he would not diſcover the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his deſigns, whilſt he had a Perſon ſo near him as his Son capable of defeating them: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a fair pretence to ſend him farther off; he gave Orders that night that he ſhould prepare for a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into <hi>Germany</hi> within four and twenty hours. The Prince had a long time expected that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and yet he could not receive it without changing his colour: He produced certain reaſons to defer it for ſome time, but the Emperour would hear none of them; all the favour he could find, was only to be permitted private Converſation with <hi>Conſtance</hi> for a while. The farewel of theſe two Lovers was extremely kind, accompanied with great proteſtations of fidelity. This place would make a marvellous Ornament for a Romance, and I ſhould have a great care how I paſt it over in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, were this a Romance, and not a Hiſtory;but the ſtyle of Annals do not ſuit with Rhetorical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and therefore I ſhall refer my curious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the paſſionate partings in <hi>Cirus</hi> or <hi>Clelia.</hi> As ſoon as the Emperour was delivered from the preſence of the Prince, he laid aſide his former diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation: He made his Viſits to <hi>Conſtance</hi> openly, and preſuming that the young Ladies profeſſion would not admit him to diſcourſe his Intrigues in the Secular forms, he told her bluntly at once, what he underſtood of her affairs. The Lady was (doubtleſs) much ſurpriſed at the Complement: She denied it couragiouſly, and believed that it was enough to have hindred the Maſcarade from ever,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65131:59"/>having been, if ſhe ſwore ſtoutly there had been no ſuch ting. But <hi>Frederick</hi> having wherewithal to convince her by his own Eyes, he ſhew her the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe interlined with the Princes, and ſwore as heartily as ſhe, he would ſhew it his Holineſs, if ſhe did not oblige him to the contrary by an ingenuous confeſſion. This Menace made poor <hi>Conſtance</hi> to tremble, ſhe betook her ſelf to her whimpering, and her tears, and beſeeched the Emperour that he would not ruine a Perſon of ſo Illuſtrious Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſe Reputation was entirely in his hands. That it was true indeed her Curioſity had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcreet, but that at the bottom it was innovent, and that as to her Intrigue and Correſpondence with his Son, it was the common Entertainment of young people, and had no other end but the diverſion of their minds, and a harmleſs affectation of making innocent Love. <hi>Frederick</hi> countefeited a belief of what ſhe ſaid: He was too cunning to teſtifie the ſuſpicion of a Crime, which would have put an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible obſtruction upon all deſigns. But the more he fancied her to be chaſt, the more obſtinate he was in his deſires to debauch her. Had you conſummated your Intrigues with my Son, Madam, ſaid the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, I would dye a thouſand deaths before I would propoſe any thing of that nature for my ſelf; I am too good a Father to him, and not ſo impious inclined. But, Madam, the Amours and Gallantry betwixt you two having been ſo innocent, it cannot hinder you at all from granting me ſome favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble indulgence. Theſe Propoſitions were cloſe, and <hi>Conſtance</hi> could not hear them without horrour, ſhe cryed out in her heart for the aſſiſtance of her
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65131:60"/>dear Prince, ſhe accuſed her ſelf of imprudence in letting him go, and ſhe uſed the utmoſt of her Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick to mollifie his Majeſty, and render him leſs importunate. But he was a Perſon for diſpatch, not eaſily changed in any thing he undertook, and would have thought it a great diminution to his Honour, ſhould he have been wheedled out of his deſigns by a pitiful Nun. To make him deſperate, was but to juſtfie his Revenge; to ſatisfie him, was to tranſgreſas the Laws, both humane and Divine; all therefore that <hi>Conſtance</hi> could do was but to beg time, and he gave her much leſs that ſhe deſired. But ſhe was to be contented with what <hi>Frederick</hi> would give her; ſhe was in no caſe to ſtand upon Conditions. As ſoon as ſhe was rid of ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom an Entertainment, ſhe ran immediately for Counſel to her three Companions. And having told them in what danger they were of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, ſhe conjured them to aſſiſt her in ſo peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a ſtation. The moſt timorous of the three was preſently for ſatisfying the Emperour, it was indef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to her what Victime they ſacrificed to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, ſo it rendred it favourable. But <hi>Conſtance</hi> was for dying a thing a thouſand times, rather than following her direction. She loved the Prince, and the Tyrannical proceedings of his Father, made her abominate him. It was concluded at laſt that ſhe ſhould ſuſpend him, and keep him in hopes, till ſhe could by ſome opportunity or perſwaſion reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Letter out of his hands, which was the only Evidence againſt <hi>Conſtance:</hi> and that having reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that, ſhe ſhould then handle him as ſhe pleaſed for his ſacrilegious Attempt. <hi>Conſtance</hi> pondering
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65131:60"/>very ſeriouſly about this reſolution, ſhe did two things at one time, both oppoſite, and yet both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwetable to her Policy and Addreſs. She writ word to his Holineſs, That the frequency of the Emperours Viſits alarm'd their Society, and diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in the Exerciſes of Devotion: for which reaſons ſhe did humbly intreat that out of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral care, he would forbid him any ſuch Civilities for the future: And having at the ſame time inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated privately to <hi>Frederick,</hi> that ſhe deſired infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely to ſee him, ſhe put him upon a ceceſſity of diſpleaſing the Pope, and furniſht her ſelf with a juſtiſiable pretence, to receive them no more. This Expedient made great difference betwixt the Pope and the Emperour; ſo that for ſome few days <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> was quiet. But <hi>Frederick</hi> being too tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Prince to give over upon the firſt difficulty, bethought himfelf of a Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battery for the Pope. He put <hi>Conſtance</hi> in the number, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf a Benefactor to the Covent where ſhe was. There was not a night but he pretended ſome heavenly Revelation, which required him to enlarge both the Revenue, and Fabrick of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery. He deſigns a Dormitory in this place, a Chappel in that. The Governeſs lookt upon him as the Tutelar Angel of her Order, and the Hloy Father himſelf relenting at ſo ſpecious a promiſe, magnified <hi>Frederick</hi> for his good intentions, and blamed his Niece for having interpreted them ſo unchriſtianly. The Emperour finding himſelf ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the Pope, began to reſs <hi>Conſtance</hi> again to a final reſolution, the Walls of the Covent were broken down in ſome places, in order to his build
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65131:61"/>ſo that <hi>Conſtance</hi> might honour him with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular meetings that way, if ſhe thought good; and if ſhe did not, he ſwore deſperately he would be revenged. <hi>Conſtance</hi> obſerving his reſolution, concluded her condition ſo deſperate, ſhe was now or never to make uſe of what remedies ſhe had. She came to an agreement with the Emperour, and gave him an aſſignation in the night. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour got very punctually into the Garden, at one of the Breaches: And all things being prepared both within and without, <hi>Conſtance</hi> preſented her ſelf, where the Emperour attended. She fell into a large Encomium of his confidence, told him that that was the ſureſt way to win her heart, and having ingaged to follow what directions he would give her, ſhe conjured him to return her the Letter, and to chuſe rather to receive her favours from her own pure will, than to owe them to any fear or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, which would be unworthy of either of them. Whilſt this Letter is in your hands, Sir, ſaid ſhe, you will always believe you obtain that by force, which nothing but your merit ought to make you to hope. This imagination muſt needs trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your joy, and I am perſwaded you are of a more gentle and delicate temper, than to govern like a Tyrant, where you may reign like a lawful Prince. Reſtore my Letter then, I conjure you, I beg it in the name of whatever it be that is moſt dear to you, and I do promiſe my acknowledgements ſhall follow your Generoſity ſo cloſe, you ſhall not have time to repent you of any thing you do. This Propoſition was not pleaſting to <hi>Frederick:</hi> He had a mind <hi>Conſtance</hi> ſhould make the firſt ſtep, and told
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65131:61"/>her ſhe ought to have the ſame confidence in his word, as ſhe deſired he ſhould have in hers: But the conning Nun knew to complain ſo artificially of his injuſtice to her ſincerity, ſhe was ſo apt to take his unkindneſs to heart, and he was ſo well pleaſed with her tenderneſs, it was not poſſible for him to refuſe her any longer. He pulled the Letter out of his Pocket, and gave it into her hands; but he was much ſurpriſed to ſee her run away with the Paper, and to obſerve that at the very firſt ſtep of her flight, he heard ſome body cry fire round about the Covent. This noiſe was made by her three Companions from their ſeveral Poſtes, they had agreed among themſelves of this Stratagem before, and the Emperour ſuſpecting nothing of it, was advancing towards the houſe to examine what might be the reaſon. But the Confuſion was ſo great, and his Train which he had placed without, hearing the Name of <hi>Frederick,</hi> and Emperour, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reiterated in the Covent, they perſwaded him ſo forcibly, that it was not ſafe for him to ſtay longer in the Garden, that he retird with all ſpeed, and went directly to his Palace, ſo mad and outragious at the Trick they had put upon him, that had he followed the firſt motions of his Choler, he would have ſet fire to the Monaſtery indeed, and ſacrificed <hi>Conſtance</hi> and all her Siſterhood to the juſtice of his reſentment. But not thinking himſelf ſtrong enought at that time in <hi>Rome,</hi> he durſt not attempt ſo great a piece of violence, beſides it would not have been eaſie for him to have done it; for at the firſt Alarm about the Town, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that ſome body was ſtealing his
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65131:62"/>Holineſs his Niece, the Monaſtery was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encompaſſed with ſuch a number of Souldiers, it would have been a difficult matter to have made any ſuch Attempt. The Popeſent one of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to inform himſelf of the particulars. <hi>Conſtance</hi> told her ſtory ſo well, there was no body but belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her. She ſaid ſhe had been drawn by force out of her Cell, and carried into the Garden, whence they had certainly conveyed her through the breach of the Wall, had not the Cryes of her Companions (who heard her skreek out) prevented their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. This Tale was ſo well invented, and the Evidences againſt the Emperour ſo probable, that the Pope doubted not in the leaſt but the Emperour was the Author of this Tumult. <hi>Conſtance</hi> had long ſince complained of his Viſits. She affirmed ſhe heard his voice in the throng: He went abroad that night attended by ſeveral armed men, and had been met in the ſtreet with his Mirmidons, by ſome of his Holineſſes Servants, which put the Pope into the higheſt indignation againſt the raſhneſs of that Prince. He commanded his Guards to their Arms, he beſet the Emperours Palace, with reſolution to revenge himſelf for the indignity done to him in the perſon of his Niece. But <hi>Frederick</hi> had prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his diligence, he had withdrawn himſelf and his Family into the Quarters of one of his Troops, where he complained as much of the Affront done to him, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did on the other ſide. From hence it was aroſe that famous War betwixt the <hi>Guelfs</hi> and the <hi>Gibelins,</hi> which was the deſolation of <hi>Italy</hi> for ſo long time, and divided all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſtendom. The publick pretence was,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65131:62"/>That the Pope refuſed the Biſhoprick of <hi>Ravenna</hi> to a Favourite of the Emperours, but the occult cauſe was <hi>Conſtances</hi> rejection of the Emperours Love, and that paſſion being turned into Rage, by the Trick ſhe had put upon him, it is a hard matter to deſcribe the effects that rage did produce. <hi>Rome</hi> was pillaged, his Holineſs forced to abandon the holy See, and ſeek Sanctuary in <hi>France:</hi> Autipopes where choſen, Excommunications thundred abroad; and all theſe the conſequence of a fatal Amour; though of ſo many dire accidents are reported in Hiſtory, there are few people that can trace them from their true ſource and Original. The ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Frederick,</hi> and the perverſneſs of the Pope are generally charged with theſe diſorders: The latter hath been condemned of ſeverity; the firſt of an injuſtifiable deſign upon the Lands of the Church. The <hi>ſuper Aſpidem &amp; Baſiliſcum</hi> of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> the Third is recorded in Capital Letters in all the Relations of that time. But there are few <hi>Memoires</hi> which attribute that to <hi>Conſtances</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, which Hiſtory imputes to the Protector of the Antipope: and thus it is the great Affairs of the World are ſecretly carried on: They have all ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faces, and we ſee nothing but as the partiality or ignorance of the Hiſtorian repreſents. But without fear of digreſſing too much from the ways of truth, we may always mingle ſome amorous Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences with the Accidents which ſeem moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and foreign to that paſſion; for if we take our meaſures right, there is ſeldom any paſſage, how Tragical ſoever it may appear) of which the Annals of Love may not become a Chronological
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65131:63"/>Hiſtory. As <hi>Conſtance</hi> was the ſecret Cauſe of the War, it was but juſt ſhe ſhould give her Uncle all the aſſiſtance ſhe could to maintain it. She writ word to Prince <hi>Henry</hi> all the violences the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had deſigned againſt her, and the ways ſhe took to defeat them. Jealouſie hath been always a kind of Apple of Contention, which ſpares not the moſt Sacred Alliances. The Emperour was moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently jealous of his Son, as well in point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as of Love. He ſaw he had a great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Army, and he imputed the Affront <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> had done to him, to her paſſion for his Rival: ſo that the ſecret diſſatisfactions of the Prince, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating with the ill diſpoſition of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours mind, they began to look upon one another with diffidence, to that diffidence ſucceeded indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and to that, an irreconciliable diſunion. The Prince deſerted him, and went to the Pope, who having interdicted <hi>Frederick</hi> for his Attempts againſt the Eccleſiaſtical See, offered <hi>Henry</hi> to make him Emperour, though his Father was ſtill living: and certainly the Condition he required was but reaſonable; it was only that he ſhould marry <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of <hi>Sicily</hi> his Niece: he told him that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that ſecurity, he could not relye upon the word of the Prince; But in ſhort, the Intrigues of his Niece were come to his knowledge, and he found it troubleſom to conceal them; and as certain it is, <hi>Henry</hi> would been have glad if the Popes Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity had been entire without terms. He loved <hi>Conſtance</hi> moſt paſſionately, but every one knows.</p>

They had made Love as furiouſly as he, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them conſiderable advantages, and the Pope was in ſo good an humour at that time, he would have given Diſpenſations to the whole Covent, if his Niece had deſired it. But they who were his Camarades in his Amours, would by no means bear him Company in his Marriage. They told him that if they were as accompliſht as he, they might undertake any thing upon confidence of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; but for them who had not been ſo great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites of Nature, they could not but fear the Laws of Wedlock might be as caſily violated, as the Rules of a Covent: That in ſo tender a point one could not be too cautious, and that if the worſt happened that could be, and they muſt marry, they deſired
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65131:64"/>to do it upon his terms, and have an equivalence to the Empire of the Weſt, for their Wives Portion. The Prince did not think it convenient for his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to the Nuns, to renounce his poſſeſſion of the Empire, He left them unkindly in their Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery to deplore the ingratitude of the Gallants, and launcht himſelf alone into that Gulf in which his Aſſociats had repreſented ſo many difficulties.

And now let us take our leave of our new Emperour and Empreſs, and take a freſh turn about the World, to ſee if we can find any new Adventure in that Age, that may be fit to cloſe up our Annals of this year.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> indued with much natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Chaſtity, and as much Experience as ſixteen years of age could confer, was married to <hi>Eleoner</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> Aunt to the King which reigned in that Kingdom at that time, who for the number of her years, and her own inclination, was as well skilled in matters of Love, as her young Husband was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. This Princeſs had an Amour with a <hi>Caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Lord, whom ſhe loved moſt paſſionately. She had paſt her Faith to him, and attended it with ſo many oaths and imprecations, ſhe might juſtly fear
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65131:64"/>the Juſtice of Heaven would follow her, if ſhe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed. For this reaſon ſhe did what ſhe could not to marry the King of <hi>Arragon.</hi> She caſt her ſelf a thouſand times at the King of <hi>Caſtiles</hi> feet, though he was but her Nephew: She wept, ſhe ſob'd, ſhe threatned to ſtarve her ſelf, but her tears, and her prayers were to as little purpoſe as her threats. The Marriage was concluded by the Counſels both of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to both Nations. <hi>Eleonor</hi> uſed her utmoſt to prevent it: But Princeſſes of her Quality are as ſo many Sacrifices to the Policy of their Countries, and never to be diſpoſed of by their own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The new Queen ſeeing her ſelf forced upon a Match which gave her ſo many ſcruples, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of a way by which ſhe might like a conſtant Miſtreſs, continue faithful to her Gallants. She ſuborned an ancient Phyſician to inſinuate into her young Husband, that he could not marry <hi>Eleonor,</hi> that there were invincible obſtacles in the way which oppoſed its Conſummation. The young Monarch, who was ſcarce got out of his Infancy, had never ſeen Woman (as it were) but his Queen Mother, his Governeſſes, and Nurſes, and had been always told that <hi>Eleonor</hi> was a ſprightly Princeſs; believed what was told him very honeſtly: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that he had heard it wiſht ſeveral times that he would provide Succeſſors for the Crown, he underſtood it a great ſhame and misfortune for him, to be unable to ſatisfie the deſires of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. This conſideration rendred him ſo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, he could not indure the ſight of any body. He ſhut himſelf up whole days together in his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65131:65"/>if he went walking, it muſt be alone; and having read in the Hiſtories of that Kingdom, what ſorrow ſome of his Predeceſſors had conceived for want of Iſſue, and what ill Conſequences had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the default of Heirs in ſeveral Kingdoms, the good Prince (who had an apprehenſion above his Age) began to look upon himſelf already, as the object of his Subjects hatred and contempt. Thoſe who had the care of his Perſon, perceiving his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and Complexion changed, intreated him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times to tell the reaſon of his Melancholy; but he anſwered with nothing but ſighs, and the Queen confirming him daily in the Errour he was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, he propoſed it himſelf, that <hi>Eleonor</hi> ſhould take her own liberty. The Queen had in her Train a young Lady called <hi>Thereſia de Bidaura,</hi> witty, and handſom, and to whom the Perſon of the King was not ſo indifferent as to the Queen: She was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and brought along with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Eleonor</hi> out of <hi>Arragon.</hi> This Lady (finding the young Monarch exactly according to her mind) had ſtudied all his actions, and took all the care ſhe could poſſibly to pleaſe him. She invented ſundry Dances, and other Paſtimes with her Companions, on purpoſe to divert him. If he did her the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſpeak to her at any time, ſhe would be ſure to make him ſmile with the wittineſs of her anſwer; and kindneſs producing uſually the like, <hi>Bidanra</hi> became by degrees as dear to the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> as the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> had appeared amiable to <hi>Bidaura.</hi> The firſt apparition of his Love was in little confidences only, as in diſcovering to her his thoughts and Characters of the great Lords in his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65131:65"/>Court. From theſe trifles he paſt higher, and at length told her the ſecret of his Marriage, and that he was <hi>Eleonor</hi> Husband only by name. <hi>Bidaura</hi> was exceedingly ſurpriſed at a diſcourſe ſo little underſtood. She lookt earneſtly upon the King, as if by ſo doing, ſhe could diſcover the truth of what he ſaid in his eyes, and not perceiving any thing in his perſon, but what ſeemed to accuſe him of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating, ſhe ventured to tell him, That he had bin abuſed, and that what they had perſwaded him, was nothing but a Chimaera. Alas, replied the young King very ſadly, this Chimaera is too real for my repoſe, one of the moſt famous Phyſicians of our Kingdom hath ſworn it, and <hi>Eleonor</hi> her ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms me that it is true: What advantage would it be to her to put ſuch a fallacy upon me? ſhe would rather convince me, if it were otherwiſe. <hi>Bidaura</hi> ruminating upon what the King had told her, deſired to know the Phyſicians name, who had perſwaded him of that impotency, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was a <hi>Caſtilian</hi> (who ſhe knew was entirely at the Queens diſpoſal) ſhe ſtood ſtill for ſome time, as recollecting her memory, when ſtarting out on a ſudden, and clapping her hands together, Courage, Sir, ſaid ſhe to the King, you ſhall be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red very ſuddenly, now the cauſe of your diſtemper is known. After which words ſhe fell into a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the intimacy betwixt <hi>Eleonor</hi> and the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillian</hi> Lord: That all <hi>Caſtile</hi> believed they had been privately married, and recollecting that the Phyſician (which upon the Queens perſwaſion had put that Errour into the head of the King) had all his life long been a Creature of <hi>Eleonors</hi> Gallant,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65131:66"/>ſhe repreſented to his Majeſty how probably it was that this might be a deſign to preſerve the Queen of <hi>Arragon</hi> to her ſecret Husband. The King was much ſatisfied at the likelihood of what <hi>Bidaura</hi> had ſaid, and he would have given half his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to have been cured ſo well. He went imme drately to <hi>Eleonor,</hi> and charging her poſitively with what <hi>Bidaura</hi> but ſuſpected, ſuppoſing he had made ſome further diſcovery, ſhe confeſt is without much ado. But it was with ſuch ſtrong proteſtations, that ſhe could uſe him no otherwiſe without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to all Law both humane and divine; and with ſuch inſtant ſupplication that he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect her againſt the indignation of her Nephew, That the young Prince was ſo far from reproaching her for abuſing his Credulity and ſmall Experience. that he commended her fidelity to her firſt Love, and promiſed her protection. In the mean time <hi>Bidaura</hi> began to add Ambition to her Love, at firſt ſhe aſpired only to be his Miſtreſs; but finding the Queenſhip of <hi>Arragon</hi> vacant, ſhe fancied it might fall to her ſhare to ſupply it, She dreſt, and made her ſelf as lovely as poſſible, ſhe redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled her diligence, and Complacences, and having brought the King to a Condition of making tryal of his recovery, ſhe knew ſo well how to keep her ſelf within the bounds of Civility, ſhe put him upon the firſt motions of Matrimony. The Marriage of <hi>Eleonor</hi> and the King was not quite nulled. The truth is, it had never been conſummated, and the Counſel of <hi>Arragon</hi> had ſent to <hi>Caſtile</hi> and to <hi>Rome</hi> to preſs an abſolute diſſolution, but Affairs betwixt Kings and Queens are not ſo eaſily diſpatcht. The
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65131:66"/>paſſion of <hi>Eleonor</hi> for her Paramour might decline by degrees; if ambition or ſolid reaſon ſhould take the place of her Love, it would have been more caſie to break her pretended Marriage with her <hi>Caſtillian</hi> Lord, than her publick Contract with the King of <hi>Arragon.</hi> We may ſay then that <hi>Eleonor</hi> was the Wife of <hi>James,</hi> till further Order from his Holineſs. But the King preſt by <hi>Bidaura</hi>'s Charms, could not with patience believe thoſe Formalities were to be prefer'd before the deſires of his heart. He married <hi>Bidaura</hi> privately, and this Marriage being as blameable as it was unequal, he made it in his Conditions that ſhe ſhould not diſcover it. This Propoſition was not at all pleaſing to <hi>Thereſia,</hi> and ſhe did what ſhe could poſſibly to divert him; but finding the King obſtinate, and inexorable, ſhe thought it good to be a Queen upon what terms ſoever it might be: And theſe were ſome of the Articles agreed on betwixt themſelves, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be of ſome uſe to the Reader, if he be in the ſame predicament.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE THIRD PART.</head>
               <p>IT is the Univerſal Confeſſion of the whole World, that Conſtraint creates an appetite of Liberty; we deſire nothing ſo ardently as what is prohibited, and yet ſome Husbands there are which cannot be cured of reſtraining their Wives. The <hi>Italians</hi> be the Husbands in the World the moſt lyable to this kind of madneſs, and are by conſequence moſt ſubject to the ill Accidents which follow. They tell ſtories of their revenge
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65131:68"/>upon their Wives, which would paſs for Prodigies in any other place, where their Captivity doth not authorize them. But the moſt pleaſant (in my Judgment) that ever was tranſmitted by Hiſtory, was that which happened betwixt the <hi>Roman</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and the <hi>Traticelles.</hi> Theſe honeſt Gentlemen were near twenty young Fellows, living about four hundred years ſince. In their time there was a great year of Gallantry in <hi>Rome,</hi> and Courtſhip: The Lovers running like Rats up and down the ſtreets all night long, ſometimes with their Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nads, ſometimes petrolling under the Windows of the moſt illuſtrious Houſes, in hopes of a happy glance from the Perſons they adored. But theſe amorous Exploits being too frequent to be private, the ſuſpicious Husbands took the Alarm, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the number of their Spies to ſuch a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that that Trade was in a ſhort time quite interrupted. The young Devots we mentioned before, were heavily afficted at that ſad Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they had had no ſhare in the nocturnal Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantries which had paſt, and they thought it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable that they ſhould be puniſht for the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of other people. Seeing then this Clutter and publick Oſtentation of Love, had been the cauſe of ſo much diſorder, they reſolved to carry on theirs privately, and <hi>à la Sourdine,</hi> without giving any more occaſion of Jealouſie than needs muſt. They pretended to live very recluſe, they affected an outward mortification, and forming themſelves into a new Religious Order under the Name of <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticelles,</hi> they became in a ſhort time ſo venerable for their viſible piety, that they were never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65131:68"/>but as a new ſort of Anchorets. Some of the moſt unquiet, and worſt coupled Husbands, had a great curioſity to ſee theſe Devots; thoſe perſons who are under the anxiety of that Domeſtick care, find great comfort in pious Diſcourſes, and the Converſation of theſe <hi>Fraticelles</hi> being then very grateful, there was ſcarce a married man in <hi>Rome</hi> but expected from their charitable admonitions, the Converſation of his Wife, were ſhe never ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant. The Husbands were mad to be at home, to tell their Wives of this new Inſtitution: and the good Women looking upon the pretence of a Viſit, as a good opportunity to gad, expreſt great ſatisfaction at the News, and had a ſtrange deſire of ſeeing theſe good Brethren immediately. By this means the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> were viſited, by degrees, very often; and the good men at home, as well contented as might be. For the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> (for the better eſtabliſhment of their Dominion) preacht nothing but Conjugal Love, Fidelity, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the Wives towards their Husbands; and variety of ſuch other Precepts as were very uſeful for the tranquillity of a Family, and of great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the Gentleman at home. But becauſe what was good to be ſaid to the one, might not perhaps be proper or agreeable to the other, they deſired the good Women would come by themſelves, to the end, ſaid they, <hi>That we may labour the more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually for your entire Converſion.</hi> There was no great difficulty of obtaining that mark of their reſpect; they had rather go th Church, than not ſtir out at all; and the private Lectures of the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> not appearing ſo hard to be put in practice, as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65131:69"/>of the Ordinary Prieſt; they became very aſſiduous, to the great ſatifaction of their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. See, Daughter, ſaid one of the cunningeſt of the Fryars, to one of the handſomeſt of the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents one day; Appearances, and ſecious Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are the Children of Prudence, which coſt but little bringing up, and are of great uſe in Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. What pleaſures do you find in the diſorders of a jealous Husband? Alas, is it not an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to deceive him; a little Kiſs given opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hides a bluſh ſometimes from his eyes, that (had he ſeen it) would have been as welcome, as a Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to his heart. A counterfeit ſorrow when you take your leave, makes him the more courteous, and haſtens your departure. And to ſpeak truth, we do very well conſider, all fleſh is but frail, we do not (when you come for inſtruction) expect you ſhould be Statues of Marble. All that we admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh is this, that you ſtudy the humour of your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and cajole it ſo cunningly, that they may not complain, and you do as you pleaſe. Love what is lovely, write Letters, appoint Meetings, 'tis no matter, they are things not criminal in themſelves; it is the pratling, and diſcovery that makes the Crime: and that it is ſo, let me ask you, do not you know <hi>Segniora Petronilla,</hi> who lives at the Corner of the <hi>Via Appia?</hi> Yes certainly, replied the Penitent, my Husband caſts her every day in my diſh, and propoſes her to me as an admirable Example of Vertue; and doubtleſs ſhe is one of the wiſeſt Women in <hi>Rome.</hi> You are miſinformed, good Daughter, as to that, replied the Confeſſor, ſhe hath had ten Gallants in her time, and I know
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65131:69"/>them all my ſelf. The Marqueſs <hi>Cocles</hi> was one of them, he courted her two years together., and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her ſcore it was the brave <hi>Brundiviſi</hi> was killed. The money ſhe pretended to give to the poor, was carried privately to a younger Brother of the Houſe of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini</hi> by a Templer, an Acquaintance of mine; and that Father you ſee with her ſo often with long ſleeves, was formerly one of our Fraternity, baniſht for his licentiouſneſs, and is now driving on an amorous Intrigue with her, under pretence of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Conference, but I muſt needs ſay the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite hath Wit, ſhe diſguiſes her inclinations with a viſible modeſty; ſhe careſſes her Husband, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies with him in every thing, and makes the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants pay him a moſt tranſcendant reſpect. Thus indeed it is Husbands ought to be dealt with; thus would I have you do with yours, and I'le aſſure you I ſpeak it out of a true Charity for you. Such ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Doctrine as this could not chuſe but produce great effects in all the diſcontented Families. The moſt croſs-grain'd Wife of them all, became a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Complacency, and the Husbands came in Troops to give the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> thanks for the repoſe they had procured. The Fryars perceiving their Reputation pretty well ſetled, they began to reflect about their own private felicity. They choſe from amongſt them a Superior, they called Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> an acute man, eloquent, his gravity and ſupercili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs impoſed upon the World, and his outward Converſation he managed as he pleaſed. This new Governour choſe out of the reſt twenty of the youngeſt, the cunningeſt, and the moſt plauſible men he could find, and as it were reſtraining the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65131:70"/>piety of the Order to this number, he choſe as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhe-Penitents for them, and (one half by Lot, and another by Election) beſtowed them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Brethren, ſo that each of them had one. Having ſetled their Chapter in this manner, they devided the reſt of their Congregation into two inferiour Orders, one of which being abſolutely ignorant of what paſt amongſt them, believed the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> as really devout as they pretended to be, and applying themſelves wholly to the care of the Family, they made Sweet-meats and Reſtauratives for the Favourits of <hi>Conrade.</hi> The laſt Order of of this terreſtrial Hierarchy was a certain number of old men, who being paſt the emulation of other peoples felicity, and finding great Relief in the Magnificence of the Fryars, they went up and down magnifying their Sanctity, inveigling Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and endeavouring to corrupt ſome Notary or other, to foiſt them into the wills of rich men, that their Eſtates might eſcheat upon their Covent: And theſe Diſciples were called the Secular Brethren. The Patron of this Society was one <hi>Hermanus,</hi> whom they honoured with the addition of <hi>Happy,</hi> and he was the firſt man amongſt them that thought upon this Inſtitution. The ſhe-Penitents or Female <hi>Fraticelles</hi> were inrolled in this Cloiſter; and this <hi>Hermanus</hi> having been polluted with as many Hereſies in his Faith, as Enormities in his Manners, the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> made uſe of his Name, and Opinions to ſupport their falſe Explications of Scripture, and the ill Doctrines they diſſeminated among the credulous people. An Order ſo well contrived, ought not to be without its Rules and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65131:70"/>Conſtitutions. The more ignorant Fryars had the Rules of a certain Fryar very famous in the Church propoſed to them, which they obſerved with all rigour; but the <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> and more Priviledged Fryars, had their particular Canons by themſelves, of which theſe following are ſome fragments which with grea labour and charge we have collected out of the beſt Libraries of this Age.</p>

                     <hi>A</hi> Young man called to the Profeſſion of a <hi>Frati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles</hi> life, ſhall be firſt examined, and give good teſtimony of his Secrecy, and exteriour Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then being tranſmitted to a ſecond tryal by one of the <hi>Fraticelles,</hi> purpoſely appointed to that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, upon his Certificate he ſhall be received into the ſaid Brotherhood, upon theſe inſuing Conditions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>I.</label> He ſhall love and honour the Lady committed to his Inſtruction, in conſideration that thoſe whom Love units, are but one Soul in two bodies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>II.</label> He ſhall preſerve the Honour of the ſaid Lady by all poſſible means, whether they be lawful or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65131:71"/>natural or unnatural: for his chief Duty is to prevent all ſuſpitions or appearances whatſoever, that may any ways reflect upon the Reputation of their Fraternity.</p>

                     <label>III.</label> He ſhall maintain to the utmoſt of his power an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and perfect <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion betwixt the Penitent and her Husband, in ſuch manner that the confidence of the Husband, may be a ſeeurity to the Gallant; Prudence being the Baſis of all amorous Converſe, and the heart of a Woman vaſt enough to receive a lawful and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited Love, without any juſtling or concuſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>IV.</label> He ſhall never mention the word <hi>Love</hi> in publick, but with the Epithet of Divine: Secrecy being the life and ſalt of an amorous Intrigue, for it is a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge worthy of death to impart an amorous Myſtery to an indifferent Perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>V.</label> He ſhall always carry two Tongues in his Mouth; he ſhall write two Hands, not only in two different, but in two oppoſite ſtyles, ſo that upon good occaſion he ſhall at the ſame time be able to ſend pious Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the young Fryars, and Madrigals to his Miſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>He ſhall indiſpenſably practiſe the motions of his Countenance, and when, and which way to change

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe holy Conſtitutions were ingraven upon a Table of Copper, and hung up in <hi>Conrards</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as well that (by vertue of his private Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) he might alter what he pleaſed; as that he was the Perſon of the Society more eſpecially ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to put them in practice. Having diſpoſed things in this good order without, it was thought convenient to make ſome directions for whthin. The care of their Houſes taking up all the good Womens time in the Mornings, and their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in the Afternoon being too liable to obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was coucluded they ſhould make choice of the night for their Aſſemblies, and the pretence of theſe Vigils, being Devotions, the moſt jealous Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands in the City ſollicited their Wives many times to repair to them often. From this point of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution, Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> paſt to the Muſter of his new Penitents: He found them too numerous for his <hi>Fraticelles,</hi> and this redundancy was a trouble to them, they could not be at leiſure to perform all the Offices of Directors as they required: To reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy this, it was concluded their Fraternity ſhould be augmented, but their Revenue being judged too ſmall, it was reſolved, they ſhould apply themſelves to ſome of the moſt eminent and wealthy Ladies in <hi>Rome,</hi> and to draw them to a Contribution for the ſupport of their augmentation.</p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:65131:72"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> Siſter to Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth, who was Pope at that time, was the firſt Perſon they addreſt themſelves to. She was a Widow, and paſt the prime of her age, and yet handſom enough; ſhe was rich, and liberal, and had a great influence upon her Brother the Pope, from whom by her mediation they hoped to obtain many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. They imployed themſelves therefore una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly might and main, to get her Ladiſhip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled in their Fraternity. This Princeſs had a Siſter called <hi>Valentina,</hi> one of the moſt zealous Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents belonged to their Fryary: ſhe was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, ſhe thought the Name of God ſounded well, upon any occaſion whatever, and this <hi>Valantine</hi> was fallen to the Lot of Fryar <hi>Robert,</hi> the moſt intimate with <hi>Conrard</hi> of the whole Chapter; and the moſt capable of ſucceeding him, had his place happened to have been vacant. Fryar <hi>Robert</hi> had a great mind to be nibling at <hi>Valantina</hi>'s innocent: He told her it was impoſſible the Fraternity of <hi>Herman</hi> ſhould be ſo holy in her Judgment, as it pretended to be, ſeeing ſhe had not as yet inſpired <hi>Hortenſia</hi> with a defire to be of it. That he could not but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire (having ſo great influence upon the firſt Princeſs in <hi>Rome,</hi> and making profeſſion of ſo great kindneſs to the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> as ſhe did) ſhe had not as yet brought her to their Aſſemblies, and thus mingling his flatteries and reproaches together (as he ſaw it convenient) he put <hi>Valentina</hi> into ſo good an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that ſhe was almoſt impatient till ſhe got to <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> and performed that ſervice to the <hi>Frati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles,</hi> which Eryar <hi>Robert</hi> had deſired. She named their Names in two or three of her Diſcourſes,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65131:72"/>where they were nothing to the purpoſe: when ſhe took her leave of the Princeſs, ſhe was ſtill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Fraticelles;</hi> when ſhe came into her Chamber, ſhe came always from that Covent, whenever the Clock ſtruck, ſhe muſt be gone to ſome of their hourly Devotions; nothing was ſo indifferent or occaſional, but it had ſome relation to this Order; and at length having with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual repetition of the Name of the <hi>Fraticelles,</hi> as it were broken <hi>Hortenſia</hi>'s brains, ſhe forced her at length to inquire what thoſe <hi>Fraticelles</hi> were, which were ſo much in her favour. What are they, Madam? replied <hi>Valantina,</hi> with a tone a top of the houſe: they are living Pictures of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, they are Mirrors of an Apoſtolick like; and in ſhort5, Madam, they are all the Devotion of the Earth cram'd up into a ſmall number of religious men. A great Character indeed, replied <hi>Hortenſiae</hi> ſmiling. Ha Madam, replied <hi>Valantina,</hi> one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give thoſe Sacred perſons ſo much as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. But the Princeſs interrupting her, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what extraordinary thing is it they do, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch extraordinary commendations? Do, Madam, replied <hi>Valantina,</hi> why their whole life is a continual act of Charity, they go about from houſe to houſE appeaſing domeſtick diſorders, they calm the diſquiets of the Soul by diſcourſes (for their piety) may be called Angelical; and beſides they ſhew ſo eaſie and ſo pleaſant a way to Heaven, one hath no more to do than to wiſh to be holy, and he is ſure to get thither. <hi>Hortenſia</hi> was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a ſolid Judgment, and ſingular Piety. Alas, <hi>Valantina,</hi> ſaid ſhe, it is in vain to deſcribe the way
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65131:73"/>to Heaven ſo eaſie, there is no coming thither but through <hi>many tribulations.</hi> I am not, I thank God, inclined to any great ſins; yet I can find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo difficult as to preſerve my ſelf in this World. When I reflect upon the Precepts of the Goſpel, and conſider how expreſs and bitter they are againſt the moſt indifferent actions of Mankind, I muſt confeſs I cannot but tremble, and nothing but the thought of Gods mercy re-aſſures me. True, Madam, replied <hi>Valantina</hi> in an anger, before I knew theſe people, I was of your opinion: Our ordinary Confeſſors have ſo troubled my brains with their ſcruples, I thought I ſhould be damned for the leaſt lye I told, or for hearing but a Flajulet with delight; but the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> know which way to cure a Soul of theſe Niceties. They affirm, that ſin is not but in the Law: No, hold Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Valantina</hi> correcting her ſelf, I cry you mercy, it is not ſo, they affirm (I ſay) that the Law was not made but for ſin; that before the Law, ſin which is now ſin, was no ſin: In ſhort, Madam, ſaid ſhe, I cannot range my words ſo well as they, nor make it out ſo perſpicuouſly: But ſee them, Madam, I beſeech you, and then you will do me the honour to tell me what you think of them. <hi>Hortenſia</hi> did not promiſe her to ſee them that time: She told her that naturally ſhe had no inclination to new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; that ſhe had Viſits enough already to imploy all the time her affairs would afford her. But the playing <hi>Valantina</hi> perſued her ſo cloſe, and the Princeſs was of ſo ſweet a diſpoſition, that at laſt ſhe told her ſhe would ſee them once in her life. The day being appointed for this Viſit, and <hi>Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:65131:73"/>having given Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> notice of the hour, 'tis two to one but he put himſelf into the beſt poſture he could. He put on his beſt Robe, he ſhaved, cleanſed his teeth, pickt his nails, and then launching out into the Court to meet the Princeſs to give her thanks for the great honour ſhe did him and his Fraternity, he forgot not the choice of his <hi>Grimaces,</hi> and Geſticulations, to render his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue more reſpectuful and gracious. He was a man as well bred as was perhaps in the World; he had an inſinuating way, he had got the <hi>Bel air</hi> of <hi>Bigotery,</hi> and pretended preciſeneſs, as exactly as any Courtier hath the gentile way of the Court. <hi>Hortenſia</hi> was much ſatisfied with his aſpect, and after ſome diſcourſe having deſired him to let her know the particular Practices of that Order: He told her, Madam, we know all men have their faults, and though we inquire ſtrictly into them, yet it is with the Spirit of Secrecy and Compaſſion, and our deſire is to reform them with private and familiar Examples: if Jealouſie be a Husbands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, we let him know how ineffectual it is, by the multitude of ſuſpicious Husbands, whoſe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions have ſerved for no other end but to make them more miſerable, If the Womans fault be Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, we inſtance in ſeveral ſuch Women, who by their Levity have precipitated themſelves into misfortune and ignominy, and having found by long Experience it is much eaſier to deſtroy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by Nature, than to elevate ones thoughts by ſupernatural Reaſons, we combate Vice with Vice, and by the Portraicture of the World, we reform it. But good Fryar <hi>Conrard,</hi> replied <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> is there
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65131:74"/>not ſome kind of Scandal in that way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? for by citing the Examples of other Perſons, you declare the infirmities of your Neighbour, to them perhaps which never heard of them before. Madam, replied <hi>Conrard,</hi> it is good ſometimes to commit a ſmall evil for a greater good. When a man is ignorant of his faults in his own Perſon, they are to be repreſented to him in his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, where they are not diſguiſed by felf-love or partiality; and if by the reprehenſion of another man, he comes once to reflect upon themſelf, he muſt of neceſſity grant it ſcandalous in himſelf to practiſe the ſame things which are condemnable in another. And can he not be brought to this, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Princeſs, by inculcating the Precepts of the Goſpel, and general Examples, without running into a Retail of particular mens actions? for let me tell you, let the publication of your Neighbours faults be grounded upon what foundation you will, it is in my Judgment very dangerous. Some Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries there are which the imprudence of ſome people have publiſhed, that are indifferent almoſt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and of no importance whether they be known or not; but for ſuch things as are ſecrets, or known but to very few, believe me, Fryar <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard,</hi> it is little leſs than Homicide to diſcover them. We manage all things well enough for that, Madam, replied <hi>Conrard,</hi> our very tone alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſe of what we ſay many times. That which would be a criminal reproach in the mouth of an Worldling, paſſes for charitable Inſtruction from a man in Reverence and Reputation for his Piety. The Priviledge of Devotion gives us great
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65131:74"/>Authority, otherwiſe, Madam, how could a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Director manage ſo many different Souls, and reconcile ſo many oppoſite ſentiments? it muſt needs be, that he be permitted to dilate ſometimes upon Vertue, and ſometimes upon Vice, as he ſees either of them neceſſary for his deſigns. When a Penitent relyes too confidently upon his own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and manners, we are to affrighten him out of that opinion of himſelf, before we can render him tractable and docile. Though he be vertuous in the higheſt perfection, yet he muſt be perſwaded he is in a way of wickedneſs, becauſe (as our great <hi>Herman</hi> hath very well obſerved) he that walks without the aſiſtance of a Director, is always in danger of ſtraggling; and therefore to inure the Penitent to a blind ſubmiſſion to his Director, he is to commit all his own experience and knowledge to the management of the devout perſon which directs him. The ſubmiſſion to the Orders of a Director is a holy kind of ſlavery, which leaves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing free to the diſpoſal of him that is to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: he muſt believe without ſeeing; he muſt be perſwaded without underſtanding, and obey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expoſtulation. But, Madam, I wiſh the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens would be propitious to me ſo far, as that I might reduce into practice with you the little Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments and Inſtructions, I have taken the liberty to diſcourſe to you to day: what extreme joy would it be to our whole Order, and eſpecially to the meaneſt of the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> your moſt humble and reſpectful Servant Fryar <hi>Conrard,</hi> to reduce to this holy ſubmiſſion I ſpeak of, the great, the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, the excellent, the incomparable Princeſs
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65131:75"/>
                     <hi>Hortenſia?</hi> Ha, Madam, how ſhould we build a Temple to Vertue upon the foundation of your fair inclinations; and how would the increaſe of ſo admirable a Plant, contribute to his glory, who ſhould have the honour to cultivate it. Theſe laſt words Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> delivered with ſo much fervor, that his Eyes ſparkled, his Face was transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured, and his Complexion animated with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Scarlet, which Fryar <hi>Robert</hi> deſiring ſhould be obſerved by <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> recommended to her in theſe terms, Look, Madam, I beſeech you, and ſee how our good Governours Charity hath tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. <hi>Hortenſia</hi> could hear only that ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of their Doctrine for that day; ſhe had buſineſs of importance required her attendance on the Pope, but not many days after ſhe had an opportunity of knowing much more. There was at that time in <hi>Rome</hi> a devout Perſon of the Order of S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> who dyed Archbiſhop of <hi>Florence,</hi> and was one of the greateſt Pillars of the Church. He was called <hi>Anthony,</hi> and though he was not arrived at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfection he attained afterwards; yet he deſerved it ſo well, and was in ſo fair a way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it, that <hi>Hortenſia</hi> eſteemed him exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Two or three days after <hi>Hortenſia</hi> had been with the <hi>Fraticelles, Anthony</hi> came to wait upon her, and the Princeſs being accuſtomed to give him an account when ſhe ſaw him, of all occurrences ſince ſhe ſaw him the laſt time; ſhe told him ſhe had been with the <hi>Fraticelles,</hi> and ſhe began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Conference betwixt Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> and her; but <hi>Anthony</hi> interrupting her at the firſt word, cryed out, Madam, ſee thoſe Creatures no more:
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65131:75"/>They are nothing leſs, than what they appear, and believe before I dye I ſhall ſee them exterminated by the Thunder of the Church. Why ſo? good <hi>Anthony,</hi> replied the Princeſs in a ſurpriſe, I never heard them ſpeak any thing that might deſerve that Propheſie. 'Tis true, they have a particular way of direction by themſelves; and it is poſſible, there may be as much intereſt as charity in the care they take of accommodating domeſtick differences in <hi>Rome.</hi> But <hi>Anthony?</hi> They deſign to eſtabliſh themſelves, is not my opinion ſo criminal as to draw down the Thunder of the Church; and if we examine all Societies ſtrictly, we ſhall find all of them infected with that ſort of Hereſie. It is true, Madam, replied <hi>Anthony,</hi> Covetouſneſs is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Epidemical diſeaſe, it is abominable in thoſe who are conſecrated to God, who are to give up themſelves wholly to Providence, for them it is thoſe paſſages were particularly pronounced, <hi>The birds of the air,</hi> and <hi>the lilies of the field;</hi> but, as you have obſerved very well, ſo many Societies are ſubject to that Crime, that I ſhould not impute it as a Vice peculiar to the <hi>Fraticelles,</hi> had I nothing elſe but that to excuſe them of. But, Madam, there are many more beſides that, which they are guilty of. They practiſe a pernicious Hypocriſie, which conceals the love of themſelves, under the veil of an exterior Mortification. Theſe people (who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the ſeverity of <hi>Anchorets,</hi> and ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be called by that Title) would not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the leaſt delicate, or conveniency for this life: they never open their mouths but to traduce ſome body or other, and under pretence of impugning
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65131:76"/>Vice, they diſcover the frailties of their Neighbours with unmerciful liberty. To what good is the oſtentation of their nocturnal Prayers? is it not a duty which we owe to publick Example to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at all Chriſtian Aſſemblies? if they have a mind to pray in the night, let them pray in private, and by themſelves, and not wake the whole Pariſh, that the poor man that is weary and aſleep in his bed may be rouzed to take notice they are going to their Devotions. Prayers at thoſe hours are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted but to the Religious, and ſuch perſons as by their open Profeſſion have dedicated themſelves to God; and certainly it muſt argue intolerable vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the <hi>Fraticelles,</hi> that they admit Women of all Qualifications, to be preſent at their Devotions. But, ſaid <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> theſe things (which would be abominable, if they were carried on by evil deſigns) may be well intended, and excuſable. What is your reaſon you will not have the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> ſuch as they appear? Becauſe, replied <hi>Anthony,</hi> thoſe who are really pious, ſtrive what they can to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it; but the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> on the other ſide take all the pains imaginable to divulge it: Simplicity and Modeſty is the Character of Charity; do you not obſerve how the Son of God forbid the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lepers to tell he had cured them? Examine the Conduct of the <hi>Fraticelles:</hi> do they follow our Saviours Example? on the contrary, the leaſt of their actions they cry up as a Prodigy: The leaſt ſtep towards Repentance they call Converſion: If you will believe them, there is not an Hoſpital built, or endowed but by their means, without their Care, and their charitable Exhortations all the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65131:76"/>poor in <hi>Rome</hi> had been ſtarved before now: the moſt illuſtrious Families would have been divided, had not their Counſels watcht over them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them in peace. Ah, Madam, to ſpeak truly and in Charity, what doth it concern me to know my Neighbours are hard to the neceſſities of the Poor, that ſuch a one, and ſuch a one is at difference with her Husband: let them do good as they have occaſion, but let them not boaſt of it when they have done, leſt whilſt they teach me the remedy they were forced to make uſe of, they teach me alſo the nature of the diſeaſe. The Eloquence of <hi>Anthony</hi> being invigorated by a true Chriſtian zeal, and ſuſtained by the eſteem <hi>Hortenſia</hi> had of him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a conſiderable effect in the Spirit of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. She called to mind how Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned himſelf; how much his diſcourſe ſuited with the vanity and detraction <hi>Anthony</hi> attributed to that Order; how Fryar <hi>Robert</hi> had made her take notice of the zeal of his Superiour, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with her ſelf, that if the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> were ſuch as <hi>Anthony</hi> deſcribed them, ſhe could not do better ſervice than to root them out of the Church; ſhe told the good man ſhe would inform her ſelf as well as ſhe could of them, and imploy all the intereſt ſhe had with his Holineſs to deſtroy them, if ſhe found them guilty of thoſe vices of which ſhe began to ſuſpect them. <hi>Anthony</hi> had a particular reaſon to promote the deſtruction of that Order, which the Princeſs did not know, his diſcretion permit him to declare. Theſe Hypocrites had debauched a Siſter of his, and under pretence of accommodating ſome ſmall differences betwixt her Husband and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65131:77"/>ſhe (which reaſon and time would without doubt have compoſed without their charitable aſſiſtance) they had made themſelves Maſters of their Family, diſpoſed of their Goods, and Revenue as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and governing both Husband and Wife in their own way, they drew upon them the deriſions of the ſober part, and the imprecations of all the reſt of the family. It is not to be ſuppoſed therefore, that <hi>Anthony</hi> would ſuffer <hi>Hortenſia</hi> to forget her promiſe: he preſt her on to the execution of it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry zealouſly, and the Princeſs partly in compliance with his requeſt, and partly by an intrinſick ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of piety, (being deſirous to inſtruct her ſelf in the ſecrets of their Conduct) ſcarce paſt one day without viſiting their Covent. Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting this aſſiduity quite contrary, managed the Commencement of his good Fortune with all poſſible Hypocriſie. Every morning he ſent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents of Flowers and Fruits to the Princeſs. there was not one of his Brethrens Penitents but was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in making ſome fine Works or other for <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> or if ſhe could not do it her ſelf, ſhe ſet all her Acquaintance on work quite through the Town. All theſe officious inſinuations and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of reſpect confirmed the Princeſs in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſhe ſhad conceived, that the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled much Policy with their counterfeit Charity: ſhe obſerved alſo a continual thread of detraction interwoven with all their diſcourſe; but ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered none of the abominations wherewith <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> accuſed them. Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> (who knew that upon <hi>Hortenſia</hi>'s eſteem, the entire Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Ruine of the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> depended) he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65131:77"/>but by halfs with her about the Eerours with which he infected the reſt. But at length the Princeſs having given them ſo many Viſits, they began to be perſwaded ſhe was abſolutely theirs, and the neceſſities of the Covent at that time preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Conrard</hi> on to put his ſhoulder to the work, he began to praiſe <hi>Hortenſia</hi>'s Beauty with more paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than ordinary: he found out amorous terms to expreſs his moſt ſerious Myſteries, and one day as the Princeſs was going in Pilgrimage to a Chappel ſome few miles out of Town, and was willing to permit Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> to accompany her (Religious perſons being much reverenced in <hi>Italy</hi>) the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and the reſt of her Train thought it no leſs than their duty to the Superiour of the <hi>Fraticelles,</hi> to leave him alone with their Lady. This oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity tempted him: he took her <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrella</hi> out of the hands of one of her Lacquays, and deſired ſhe would vouchſafe him the honour to do her that ſmall piece of Service. The Princeſs conſented, and the Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> thinking himſelf much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured thereby; Certainly, Madam, ſaid he (by way of acknowledgment) it is not without good reaſon that Beauty is termed a Ray of the Divinity; for we ſee no perſons admirably handſom, but they are withal moſt exquiſitely good: So that it ſeems theſe two things are inſeparable, and the Creator hath ſo well ſignified his Complacency in beautiful Creatures, that he allows them to ſhare in two Attributes which are the moſt proper to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Hortenſia</hi> ſmiled at <hi>Conrards</hi> Complement, and imagining preſently this would be a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Juncture to inform her ſelf of what <hi>Anthony</hi>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:65131:78"/>charged him, ſhe replied, Till now I was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the beauty of the body was not a quality much regarded by God; the aſpect of the Stars, or the diſpoſition of Nature, make people handſom or ill-favoured; but this ill-favouredneſs, and this Beauty contribute ſo little to the glory of God, that by common obſervation we may ſee the handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Women the moſt ſubject to be ingrateful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Creator. What is that, Madam, you call Ingratitude towards the Creator, replied <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard.</hi> I call it Ingratitude, replied the Princeſs, to imploy the Talents he hath given us for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his Power, to the Worſhip of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as moſt part of your Beauties do every day. Alas, Madam, replied the Fryar, how is your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs miſtaken in your ingratitude, ſo far is it from offending God, to make uſe of the Talents he gives us, that many times our not uſing them at all, may be more properly called Ingratitude towards the Creator. For (as our <hi>Herman</hi> ſays very well) to what end did God create Beauty but to pleaſe? and why did he give that power of Charming to Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if it were a Crime to be charmed by-them? The Princeſs perceiving Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> in ſo good an humour for diſcourſe, would not anſwer ſo as to ſilence him, but on the contrary reſolved to make her advantage of this occaſion. But Brother, ſaid ſhe, you quote this <hi>Herman</hi> ſo often, I cannot but deſire you to tell me ſomething of his Doctrine. I know you preach it up more freely to other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than you have done to me; and to tell you the truth, I do take that reſervedneſs ſomething un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly, and reſolved to complain of it the firſt time
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65131:78"/>you and I were together done. Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> was ready to leap out of his skin for joy at the Curioſity of the Princeſs, he had a long time expected this opportunity. Madam, he replied (with an alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty above his diſſimulation) we are neither reſerved as to your Highneſs, nor does your Highneſs want any neceſſary diſpoſition for the comprehending Secrets of our Doctrine; but our thrice happy and thrice Reverend <hi>Herman</hi> hath ſaid things ſo odd and novel, and they are to be heard with ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found a ſubmiſſion, that I doubted whether your Highneſs would condeſcend to the obedience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the hearing them. Yes my good Brother, replied the Princeſs, I will condeſcend, and at the ſame time ſitting down at the foot of a Tree which afforded them a competent ſhade, Come, ſaid ſhe, let us reſt our ſelves here a while, I am weary, and we may ſpare an hour for this Diſcourſe, without danger of wanting time for the finiſhing our Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> ſate himſelf down at <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi>'s feet, ſo tranſported, he could ſcarce contain his joy within the limits of his heart: The Servants which attended the Princeſs, placing themſelves at ſuch diſtance behind, that they could not hear the Harangue; the good old Fryar began it in this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>LOVE is as natural to Mankind as life. The World was made at firſt, and is ſtill preſerved for him, and the</hi> Venus <hi>of the Ancients, which they pretend animates Nature, is nothing but a deſire in every Creature to unite it ſelf with what is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. This deſire in Animals degenerates into Inſtinct;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65131:79"/>in inanimate things it becomes a natural tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Center; and in man it is the true mark of the Soul. It is not more natural for him to ſleep, nor to eat, nor to perform the other functions of life, than it is to love; and if Love be ſo natural to the people of the World, who are ſubject to ſo many other paſſions, and diverted by Secular Imployments; how much more ought it be ſo to us, who delivered from the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual activity of worldly people, paſs our whole lives in a perpetual vacation? We are to day what we ſhall be to morrow, no Dignity gives us any care, nor no fear of indigence gives us any trouble; if our Luxury be bounded, our ſubſiſtence is aſſured. Ha, Madam, is there any thing in the World like one of us Religious to receive the impreſſions of Love in perfection? It is this diſpoſition (both Phyſical and Moral) which for a long time hath peopled Heaven with Saints; for the Religious, affected, (like other men) with a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſire of loving, this deſire not being croſſed or counterballanced with Ambition, Revenge, or any other paſſions that occupy the mind of the reſt of the World; he loves</hi> with all his force, with all his ſoul, <hi>and</hi> with all his ſtrength, <hi>as S.</hi> Paul <hi>teaches. But as among Animals, there are ſome proper for the Race, and ſome for the Charge; ſo among us Religious, ſome are for one kind of Love, and others for another. The Religious predeſtinated to the Love of God, gives up his heart wholly to the Divine Love; and this is it which hath produced ſo many Martyrs and ſo many Confeſſors. The Religious who is not endued with ſo violent an inclination for Heaven, he lifts himſelf up to the Creator, by the Contemplation of his Creatures; and this, Madam, is the Vocation of the</hi> Fraticelles,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65131:79"/>
                     <hi>We love God as well as the other, but we love him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the things below; the enjoyments of this life make us admire his goodneſs, and your Beauty, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, continued the ungracious Fryar, with his wanton Eye fixt faſt upon</hi> Hortenſia, <hi>your Beauty makes me adore his Omnipotence: when I conſider the Charms ſo conſpicuous in your Perſon, and in all your actions, I do comprehend there is but one God could have created you ſo excellent, and ſo riſing by degrees to the Eternal Principle of all things, by the effects of its natural Emanations, I enjoy, as one may ſay, the delights of Heaven, and the pleaſures of the Earth at one time, my heart being divided (without Sacriledge) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt divine Love and profane, I may ſay what our</hi> Herman <hi>hath taught us, he is to be found in things (which according to the depraved ſenſe of Humanity) ſeem abſolutely contrary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is an odd Doctrine indeed, replied <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> and you had good reaſon to ſay it was novel; but, good Brother, I would fain know how you can accommodate it with the Orthodox Doctrine of the Church? for it appears to me diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to what you have expreſt. The Goſpel commands us to look upon this life but as a paſſage: the Son of God nothing more than our denial of the Creature, and that we muſt renounce Honour, and Riches, and Kindred to follow him: But you <hi>Fraticelles</hi> find him in the midſt of thoſe things he hath commanded us to ſhun; make me underſtand this Myſtery, I beſeech you. It is a great Myſtery indeed, Madam, replied <hi>Conrard,</hi> and well worthy of the acuteneſs of your Wit. We ſearch God, I
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65131:80"/>ſay, in all his works, and judging his deſign was to make man happy, ſeeing he created him after his own Image, we do endeavour to eſtabliſh this feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city by all things which render it perfect. In truth, all men being not capable of theſe kind of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſome having been ſo inhumane, as to make Laws, and eſtabliſh Maxims contrary to the felicity of this life, we frame our ſelves (as to our outward deportment) to the greater number, but it is ſo, as that we have our own private happineſs in our Eye; for we look upon publick Eſteem as one of the Conditions neceſſary to make it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat. The Princeſs thought ſhe had no need of hearing <hi>Conrard</hi> any longer, to perſwade her ſelf of the Crimes Fryar <hi>Anthony</hi> had charged upon the <hi>Fraticelles:</hi> The diſcourſe he had made abounded with ſo many Errours, and the Hypocriſie (which the Fryar had confeſt at the latter end of his Speech) was ſo formal, there needed nothing more to aſſure it. She ſtarted up on a ſudden, as if ſhe feared ſhe had forgot her ſelf, and not had time enough left for the reſt of her Journey; and diſſembling the horrour ſhe had conceived againſt the Precepts of <hi>Herman,</hi> ſhe left <hi>Conrard</hi> in great hopes ſhe would become one of his moſt zealous Diſciples. But he was much deceived in his opinion: For the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was no ſooner returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> but ſhe went to his Holineſs immediately, and aſſured him that the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> were impious Hereticks, who under the Diſguiſe of an exterior Profeſſion, concealed a moſt ungodly and diſſolute life, and therefore ſhe humbly deſired he would appoint ſome perſons to queſtion them about their Doctrine, and to apply
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65131:80"/>ſome remedy to the diſorders which would neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow upon the Church, unleſs ſome ſudden ſtop were put to their Career. <hi>Hortenſia</hi>'s charge was conſiderable, and ſhe had great influence upon the Pope, but he was ſo prepoſſeſt in favour to the <hi>Fraticelles,</hi> that the Reputation of the Princeſs had like to have been ſplit upon that Rock. Two of the Popes Officers, and of the Principal of his Houſhold (of which one was Brother-in-law to <hi>Anthony</hi>) had married two Women, but of Ages quite contrary to their own. The Siſter of <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> was young, handſom, and airy, and her Husband was about ſixty years old, grave, Philoſophical, and melancholy: he had a Siſter almoſt of his own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and age, who was married to a <hi>Roman</hi> Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, who having taken her for her money, made no great reckoning of her Perſon: The young Lady complained highly of the reſervedneſs of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and the old complained as much of the levity of hers. The <hi>Fraticelles</hi> had found a way to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile theſe differences, and to reſtore peace to their Families, which before was ſcarce to be hoped for during their lives. This great point of prudence having gained them a particular eſteem from both theſe perſons, they had perſwaded the Pope clearly in their favour. He rebuked <hi>Hortenſia</hi> with ſome kind of eagerneſs, for being ſo eaſie in receiving impreſſions to their prejudice, and commanding her never to ſpeak to him of them hereafter but with reſpect, he put her into ſo high a paſſion, to ſee her Authority affronted, that ſhe reſolved never to be quiet till ſhe had quite rooted out the whole brood of the <hi>Fraticelles:</hi> ſhe redoubled her dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65131:81"/>at their Prayers, and Aſſemblies. Though Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> had not had the confidence to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part all the <hi>Arcana</hi> of their Society, eſpecially in their nocturnal Conferences, yet ſhe thought ſhe had enough already to give her ſufficient ſuſpicion of the reſt: ſhe gave an exact account of what ſhe ſaw and obſerved to Fryar <hi>Anthony,</hi> and receiving Advertiſements from <hi>Valantina</hi> beſides, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed her in her doubts, ſhe attended only one proof more to declare her ſelf publickly an Enemy to the <hi>Fraticelles,</hi> with which Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her in a ſhort time. It was then that time of the year in which according to the Cuſtom in <hi>Rome</hi> they wiſh many years to the Perſons of Quality in that Town, and accompany their good wiſhes with ſome ſmall Preſent or other. Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> as the moſt regular, and moſt active amongſt them, was one of the firſt at acquitting himſelf of this duty: He ſent to make his Complement to the Princeſs, and preſented her by the ſame Meſſenger with a Picture of <hi>Herman,</hi> the Frame made with great Workmanſhip, and inriched with precious Stones. This new Saint of <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Paradiſe was (in the Habit of the <hi>Fraticelles</hi>) drawn upon his knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Crucifix, his Forehead crowned with Thorns, a Deaths-head in his hand, and theſe words in Capital Letters at the bottom: <hi>LET THEM THAT APPROVE, IMITATE.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony</hi> was with <hi>Hortenſia</hi> at the ſame time when this Preſent was brought her, and looking upon
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65131:81"/>him very angrily, ſee <hi>Anthony,</hi> ſaid ſhe, how theſe Hypocrites abuſe the Pictures of Penitence; to what perſons they preſent them, and what Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples they propoſe to our imitation. Marry ſuch, Madam, replied Fryar <hi>Anthony,</hi> as they would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you ſhould follow; but you muſt not leave them any longer in that liberty of propoſing them to you, you muſt preſs the deſtruction of a ſort of people ſo pernicious to the common Intereſt of the Church, and every moment that it is deferred, are ſo many favourable opportunities which we give them to do miſchief. I dare not tell your Highneſs what abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations I diſcover every day in theſe Vermine: I will not imitate their indiſcretion in telling you ſuch of their Crimes as perhaps you have not heard of: But believe me, Madam, there is no more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to be uſed in this affair, and you muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to God for the Souls of all they corrupt from the hour it was in your power to have deſtroyed them, till they be actually deſtroyed. But, good <hi>Anthony,</hi> replied the Princeſs, can I do any more than I have done already? I have inveigled them to tell me their Errours, I have carried them to the Pope, and I have juſtified the Charge by my own Teſtimony. You muſt do more than all this, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, replied <hi>Anthony,</hi> you muſt pretend great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in them, and act ſo as to give them as great a one in you; if I might perſwade you, you ſhould write to <hi>Conrard</hi> upon this occaſion, and give him thanks for the Preſent he ſent you, this might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly oblige him to anſwer you with ſome kind of Gallantry, and conduct him inſenſibly into that pit, into which we muſt endeavour with all our
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65131:82"/>power to tumble him. This Propoſition made <hi>Hortenſia</hi> tremble, it ſavoured of a kind of Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (which ſhe abhorred at her Soul) beſides ſhe could not reſolve upon any motive whatever, that any of her Letters ſhould come into the Clutches of <hi>Conrard.</hi> But <hi>Anthony</hi> repreſented ſo well to her the neceſſity of ſtopping the courſe of ſo dangerous a Sect, and (though his Charity would not permit him to let her know all that he knew of their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies) yet he gave her ſo horrible an Idea there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that ſhe called for Pen and Ink immediately, and writ to Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whence comes it, my dear Brother</hi> Conrard, <hi>you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Mortifications, and Examples of Penitence to my imitation? Is this the way to that happineſs which your</hi> Hermanus <hi>does promiſe us? ought not I to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of your diſingenuity, when I ſee the viſible marks of your Eſteem, ſo little conformable to what I already know of your Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who can expreſs the Rape the receipt of this Letter committed upon Fryar <hi>Conrards</hi> Soul? He fell into ſuch Extravagances, as the moſt worldly men would have been aſhamed of; and not willing to loſe ſo fair an opportunity to declare himſelf, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the Princeſs this Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You judge but ill, Madam, of the ſentiments of my Soul, if you believe they can be diſſembled to your Highneſs. Penetrate the appearances which abuſe you, and you will find my heart delineated in the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture you have received.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:65131:82"/>
                  <p>He that brought this Ticket to the Princeſs, had inſtruction to tell her, that ſhe ſhould take a wet Sponge, and wipe over the face of <hi>Hermanus</hi> with it: and <hi>Anthony</hi> being deſirous to underſtand the meaning of <hi>Conrards</hi> Anſwer, the Princeſs and he followed his directions with the Sponge, but were much ſurpriſed to obſerve as they rubbed the old, a new Picture to appear. <hi>Hermanus</hi> was done only in Water-colours, but under it was the figure of <hi>Cupid</hi> lying upon the green, his head crowned with Roſes, and inſtead of the Deaths-head, he held a Basket of all kind of Flowers, and about the border were written in great Letters theſe words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not from the Garden ſo much, as from my Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Hortenſia</hi> in Italian ſignifies the Goddeſs of Gardens, and ſo this Basket of Flowers alluding to the Princeſſes Name, expreſt a moſt juſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible declaration of his Love. Without jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Madam, cryed the pious <hi>Anthony</hi> when he had ſeen all: This is a ſubtle Contrivance for a Monk; one may eaſily ſee he hath paſt his Apprentiſhip: But alas, continued he (with ſomething a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Tone) he ſpoke truer than he intended, when he ſaid that this Picture was the Portraiture of his Heart. When we look upon the actions of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, they are in Water-colours, and appear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Croſſes and Mortificationa; but paſs the Sponge of ſevere ſcruting upon them, and you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover under them the moſt deteſtable vices in the World. After which words he took the Picture and Ticket into his hands, and begged of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65131:83"/>he might be permitted to carry them to his Brother-in-law, that he might by beginning with him, undeceive the reſt of the World. The zeal of <hi>Hortenſia</hi> would not ſuffer that any body ſhould ſee the Picture before the Pope, it being he that was to puniſh the falſe Brothers for their Hypocriſie; but beſides that <hi>Anthony</hi> believed that the Picture ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient alone to rectifie his Holineſs, he thought he ſhould diſoblige his Siſters Husband, if he declared <hi>Conrards</hi> Errour before he had given him time to defend him. This precaution was uſeful more than one way: for the good Brother-in-law found ſo many plauſible reaſons to excuſe <hi>Conrard,</hi> that he had fruſtrated this Complaint as he had done the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, had he ſpoke in the preſence of the Pope. What <hi>Hortenſia</hi> intends to publiſh about he impiety of the <hi>Fraticelles,</hi> ſaid he, is only about points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which ſhe doth not well underſtand. The Picture was a pious Emblem, ſignifying that true Penitents do find flowers of Comfort in their moſt ſevere Mortifications. The words about the Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket troubled him a little, but he was confident Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> would give him an innocent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, if he deſired it; and by this obſtinacy of his, he puſht forward <hi>Anthonies</hi> impatience to have him diſcovered. But what will you ſay, Brother, replied <hi>Anthony,</hi> if I let you hear <hi>Conrard</hi> make Love to the Princeſs <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> and ſpeak things directly contrary to the Doctrine of the Church? It is impoſſible, replied the Brother-in-law, you can never do it, the Superiour of the <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticelles</hi> is too pious and too diſcreet to be guilty of ſuch a fault. But in ſhort, ſaid <hi>Anthony,</hi> if I do as
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65131:83"/>I propoſe, what will you ſay then? I will ſay, ſaid the other, my ſenſes deceive me, or if they do not deceive me (and indeed I believe 'tis ſcarce poſſible they ſhould) I ſhall ſay I was inchanted for that time; for to tell you the truth, I ſhall ſooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I am not what I am, than that Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> is otherwiſe than he ought to be. It is enough, replied <hi>Anthony,</hi> leave this affair to my Conduct and be contented to keep what I ſhall tell you, as a Secret. I did at firſt make great ſcruple of publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing to the diſparagement of this Society. The Habit they wore obliged me to more reſpect for them; ſo that my firſt deſign was to charge them only with the Errours of the Doctrine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcovering any thing of the Exorbitance of their Manners, but ſeeing your Eyes are not to be opened but by a way I did hope I might have ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that contrary to the reſpect you owe to his Holineſſes Niece, you declare your ſelf the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of thoſe ſhe would juſtly ſuppreſs, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you by your own proper knowledge. The Princeſs is diſcreet, and charitable, and by all the other motives beſides that of Charity, I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have prevailed with her to oppoſe her ſelf againſt ſo much clutter and noiſe as you do create; but when I ſhall have acquainted her how far I am concerned in their diſorders, I do not deſpair but ſhe will think nothing troubleſom or difficult to relieve me. <hi>Anthony</hi> obſerved his promiſe very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly with his Brother-in-law. He came to wait upon the Princeſs the next morning, he aſſured her the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> increaſed hourly in their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that they had corrupted a great part of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65131:84"/>the moſt illuſtrious Ladies in <hi>Rome;</hi> that in their nocturnal Devotions, pretending to teach them the Art of Praying more exactly than ordinary, they took them into private places, where they ſeduced them by all ſorts of flattery, and Heretical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; and then concluding his Diſcourſe with this, That ſhe was the only Perſon qualified by God himſelf to purge the World from the infection of thoſe Hypocrites; he conjured her not to deſert the Intereſt of God and his Church any longer, but to draw <hi>Conrard</hi> into ſome <hi>Rendez-vous</hi> by ſome means or other, that by watching him, they might take him in the act, and convict him of all his Crimes at a blow. This requeſt frighted the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of the Princeſs at firſt, but <hi>Anthony</hi> ſupported it with ſo many Arguments, that <hi>Hortenſia</hi> was overcome, and promiſed to do it. She ſignified to Fryar <hi>Conrard,</hi> that ſhe well underſtood the ſenſe of his Ticket, if it were ſuitable to the ſentiments of his Soul, it was no leſs conformable to hers; and cajoling the Errour of the poor Fryar with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand proteſtations of kindneſs (which would have deluded even prudence it ſelf) ſhe obtained of him a promiſe that he would come to her Chamber one night in the Diſguiſe of a <hi>Roman</hi> Matron. She put him upon this Diſguiſe, as well becauſe it would make the iniquity of the Fryar the more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as alſo out of a remnant of the reſpect ſhe had ſtill left for a Religious habit, which would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her to ſcandalize them with ſo irreligious an interview. This Maſcarade was a little ſuſpected by Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> at firſt: it was a long time before he could be brought to part with his Habit: A deſire
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65131:84"/>to underſtand the laſt will of a dying man, or the conſolation of an afflicted Family might furniſh a Pilgrim with pretences to go abroad when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but for going in that Dreſs, he could give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no reaſon: The Princeſs however managed the buſineſs ſo well, repreſenting that her Family was too numerous to conceal one in a Religious Habit a whole night in her Palace, without being diſcovered, unleſs in ſome ſuch Diſguiſe as might take away the occaſion to ſuſpect: upon theſe perſwaſion he was overcome. He might have been more ſecure a great deal to have had the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to his Covent, and he wanted not conveniences to have entertained her at what time ſhe pleaſed to have come; but ſhe pretended a ſoreneſs in her leg, which ſtopt his mouth as to that Propoſition. In this manner the day of the aſſignation was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and arrived. <hi>Anthonies</hi> Brother-in-law was ſlipt into a Cloſet by <hi>Hortenſia</hi>'s Bed, from whence they could hear whatever was ſpoken by the Beds-ſide, and he was accompanied by his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marade. The Princeſs would receive the Fryar in her Bed, the better to perſwade him of the ſore leg ſhe pretended, and <hi>Conrard</hi> being as glad to find her in that poſture, magnified his Love for ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable a Conjuncture. Welcome good <hi>Conrard,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> what will you ſay of this piece of my kindneſs toward you? will you not confeſs it is extreme? Madam, replied <hi>Conrard,</hi> bowing his body moſt humbly, I expected no leſs than extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary goodneſs from a Perſon of your Divinity. But if it be lawful for your moſt zealous and moſt humble Servant <hi>Conrard,</hi> to declare a truth to you,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65131:85"/>which perhaps you knew before: you are not the only Lady which hath placed thoſe confidences in me. Thoſe who vouchfaſed me that honour, were not indeed of your Quality, or perfection; but they were Perſons of Honour, whoſe Beauties and Worth might have made an inſatiable Courtier, the happieſt man living. This is no more than what I have heard from other people, replied <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> and let me tell you, that this conſideration hath contributed much to your obtaining of this <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>z-vous.</hi> Had I been the only Perſon had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you this Priviledge, I ſhould have ſcrupled very much more to have done what I have; but <hi>Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> hath aſſured me I had many Companions, and her aſſurance hath given me this confidence. The Princeſs ſpake truth, though <hi>Conrard</hi> did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. It was indeed no more than what <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> had told her of the debauchery of the <hi>Frati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles,</hi> which had put her upon a reſolution of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying them, contrary to her own inclination, but becauſe we ſhould not diſcover the Name of ſo pious a Perſon, ſhe made uſe of <hi>Valantina's;</hi> and the conſciencious Fryar knowing <hi>Valantina,</hi> could diſcover much of his Intrigues, he made no difficulty to acknowledge it. True it is, Madam, ſaid he, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be only the indulgence of my Stars, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be any little Merit in me, I cannot tell; but this I muſt ſay, there is ſcarce any perſon, I think, worthy to be retained, that eſcapes me. But what ſtrange way is it that you take to oblige them? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Hortenſia:</hi> for my part I have been captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with your cares, and the expreſſions of your kindneſs, but I ſuppoſe it is not poſſible you ſhould
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65131:85"/>have done as much for every Lady in <hi>Rome,</hi> as you have done for me. The whole time of your life would not have been ſufficient, nor your Revenues able to have ſupplied you, for the very Preſents you would have made. Madam you ſay right, replied the Fryar, we do not treat all perſons alike, nor indeed any body, as we do the Great and moſt Illuſtrious Princeſs <hi>Hortenſia:</hi> But, Madam, theſe little Myſteries of our Society may well be put off to another time. No, no, good <hi>Conrard,</hi> replied the Princeſs (who underſtood his deſign) tell me, I beg of you, all your artifices, and meaſures you take with the good men; and the ſecurities you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire againſt the imprudencies, and natural levity of the greateſt part of our Sex. I have a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to underſtand theſe things, and you cannot give me a greater teſtimony of your kindneſs, than by this confidence in me. If the Princeſs <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> replied the Fryar, had been a private Lady, in vain ſhould ſhe have aſpired to the knowledge of the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> Intrigues, Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> would have conſtrained her to have deferred that Converſation; but he will not proceed with the Siſter of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Pope, as with a private perſon; her orders muſt be obeyed, let the a verſion be never ſo great. Madam, continued he, our general Maxime is, to cure Ladies of their Errours in Chriſtianity, by the Precepts of our <hi>Hermanus,</hi> and to take off their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of loſing their Reputations, by reffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much it is our intereſt to preſerve them. If we can but expunge out of Women the two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of God, and of Honour, our buſineſs is done, there is ſcarce one of them but becomes lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65131:86"/>immediately; and if ſtill they remain obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, we in that caſe betake our ſelves to more ſubtile Expedients. And here the vile <hi>Fraticel</hi> ſtretching his confidence to the higheſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting her with the moſt profound Myſteries of their Amours, there was not a neat way of writing a Note, but he taught the Princeſs how to do it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, no zealous or ſuperſtitious Preſent, but he ſhew her the Art how to convert it into a Myſtery of Love, no colour of piety, but which way it was to be perverted, and turned into debauchery; and paſſing before he was aware from numbring his Expedients, he came at length to inſtance in the perſons upon whom they had made their Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and put the Wives of the two perſons who were liſtning to his diſcourſe in the front of his Catalogue, as the moſt zealous for their Society of the whole City. The Princeſs cryed out at the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of thoſe two Ladies, had ſhe known they had been in the Liſt of their Penitents, ſhe woulod have had a care of putting <hi>Conrard</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that imprudence: but <hi>Anthony</hi> being too cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to give her any ſuch intimation, ſhe knew not that inconvenience, till it was too late to repair it. <hi>Conrard</hi> obſerving her in that trouble, you ſeem, Madam, ſaid he, to be ſurpriſed, did you take thoſe two Ladies for Veſtals, that you skreek as it were at the very hearing of their Names? I do aſſure you, Madam, tey gave us leſs trouble than any of the reſt. One, ſhe complained of the tediouſneſs of an old Husband, and we appointed her a Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor: the other could not endure the neglects of her young one, and we aſſigned her another more
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65131:86"/>complacent that her Cuckoldly Husband. <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſia</hi> (who was heartily diſpleaſed at this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, as well in conſideration of <hi>Anthony,</hi> as for the diſorders ſhe foreſaw in thoſe two Familes) repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, interrupting him, I beſeech you, Fryar <hi>Conrard,</hi> forbear this diſcourſe, it makes me tremble to hear you; you cannot ſay true, you boaſt of things you never did: the two Ladies you ſpeak of, are both of them diſcreet, I dare ſwear for them, and I look upon the occaſion I have given you to run out into this language, as an unpardonable offence. This return was not at all pleaſing to <hi>Conrard,</hi> and he had a mind to prevent what might follow. Come Madam, ſaith he, <hi>Let us leave our Divinity upon the Altar, and in the hearts of his Elect, and not mingle the diſcourſe of it with our amorous Myſteries:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Altri tempi, Altri Curi:</q>
                  <q>There is a Time for all things.</q>
                  <p>And then to apply the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb the more cloſe, he was about to have forgot himſelf quite, and loſt all reſpect for <hi>Hortenſia:</hi> But the two Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands in the Cloſet (not able longer to endure the impudence of the Fryar) came ſuddenly forth, and apprehended him: Ah, ah, Fryar <hi>Conrard,</hi> ſaid the Old man to him, is this your way of making the <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies practiſe the Vertue you preach to their Husbands. The <hi>Fraticel</hi> was amazed at the ſight of them, and at their manner of proceeding; ſo that he ſtood gaping, as if he had been Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck. He opened his eyes, without believing what he ſaw, he was ſeized all over with a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65131:87"/>his legs and his voice failed him, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to ſay a word in his own defence, nor make the leaſt attempt to eſcape <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be hal'd, like a Log into the next Chamber, where they kept ſtrick guard upon him till the hour came he was lookt for. It would be in vain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the melancholy reflections of the good Fryar; I ſuppoſe there is ſcarce any Reader but imagines it, without my deſcription: he ſaw himſelf delivered up by a Princeſs to whom he had diſcovered ſuch impieties as were worthy the cruelleſt puniſhment. The perſons he judged would appear in Evidence againſt him, were the two Husbands, whom he had wounded in the moſt tender and ſenſible part of a Husband; and this reverſe of Fortune happened at a time the expected to have been moſt happy. Whilſt he was in this uncomfortable contemplation, and tranſported with a rage that reliſhed more of the beaſt than the man; the Princeſs <hi>Hortenſia</hi> (accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by the Learned <hi>Anthony,</hi> and the two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who before had declared themſelves the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors of the <hi>Fraticelles</hi>) went to his Holineſs to juſtifie thoſe Crimes he was ſo unwilling to believe: <hi>Conrards</hi> iniquities were as good as proved, as ſoon as they were diſcovered; the knew them upon his own Declaration, and the Witneſſes which charged him, were of unqueſtionable Repute. He was ſent for therefore immediately to come and give an account of his Doctrine and Manners. He had like to have fallen down dead with fear at the delivery of that Complement; and knowing that in thoſe affairs, he is a great gainer, who gains any time, he begged of the Popes Meſſengers in the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65131:87"/>moſt ſubmiſſive terms he could uſe, that they would permit him to ſent to his Covent for his own Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit; but beſides that the Dreſs of a Matron was a great aggravation of his offence, they though it ſo pleaſant to ſee how he managed it, they could not be perſwaded from giving his Holineſs a view of him. In this Equipage therefore they conducted him to the Popes Palace. It was a pretty piece of <hi>Groteſque</hi> to ſee this famous <hi>Fraticel</hi> (who never ſhew himſelf in publick but in Sackcloth, and his head covered with Aſhes) traverſing the Grand Piazza in <hi>Rome</hi> in this Metrmorphoſis. Thoſe which carried him along, took delight in manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſhame, by not ſuffering him to hid his face, and the people which paſt by, ſeeing the Beard of a Monk peep out of an old Womans Coife, Is this the new Apoſtle? cryed one, who boaſted that he practiſed Chriſtiantity in perfection: Do you ſee that Hypocrite, ſays another, who plays the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choret all day, and goes the Rounds at night in Maſcarade, to play the amorous Gallant? I always thought, ſaid one, (who pretended to be a man of underſtanding) there was nothing but oſtentation and outſide in the piety of theſe Fryars. Forbear your Judgment, replied another, more eaſie of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, perhaps it is upon ſome charitable inſtigation he hath taken up this Habit: and theſe kind of Conjectures and Ejaculations accompanied the poor Fryar to the Tribunal, where he was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er arrived, and examined, but he was convict and condemned of moſt horrid impieties, he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over to Execution four days after he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; the Sect of the <hi>Fraticelles</hi> declared He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65131:88"/>all their Followers excommunicated, and <hi>Herman,</hi> the happy <hi>Herman,</hi> as they ſtyled him, was by his Holineſſes Decree dig'd up out of his Grave, and his bones publickly burnt. This Act of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice pleaſed <hi>Hortenſia</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> very well: but it was not ſo grateful to all the reſt of the World. Thoſe who were of the Faction of the <hi>Fraticelles,</hi> gave relief to a great number of thoſe kind of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines, who would have fallen from exceſs into neceſſity, if vice and vicious people ſhould have been utterly extermined. Some of this ſort of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht perſons preſerved a good Party of the <hi>Frati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles,</hi> and conveyed them to <hi>Lyons,</hi> where they remained during the diſorders in the Church: and from this infected Fountain it is perhaps ſuch Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of Bigotteries and Phanaticiſms do flow all the World over. The Libertines joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their fellow-Libertines. The Penitents who had been really abuſed, were glad to be brought out of their Errours, and were converted in carneſt, in which number the innocent <hi>Valantina</hi> was one. But ſuch as pretended to believe, that they might have a pretence to feed, were much troubled at the deſtruction of the <hi>Fraticelles,</hi> and ſome of this ſort of Fellow-ſufferers it muſt be who took care to provide Fryar <hi>Conrard</hi> with an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph, which with much ado we have recovered, and could not poſſibly be compoſed but by ſome of them.</p>

               <p>DEbauchery is an infernal ſeed, ſo marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly fruitful. One diſſolute Example produces a thouſand: and whereas Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue makes its Conqueſts upon Vice by degrees, and that with much labour and patience; Vice over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runs Vertue like a Torrent. The Sect of the <hi>Frati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles</hi> appeared at firſt like the effect of an Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Its progreſs imitated the ſuddenneſs of its beginning, and dilated ſo faſt, the continued care of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65131:89"/>five of <hi>Bonifaces</hi> Succeſſors were ſcarce ſufficient to extinguiſh it. In imitation of the <hi>Fraticelles,</hi> every man ſet up one Sect or other after his own Mode: But amongſt all of them, no one carried it ſo far, as <hi>Dulcinus</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Prince, and fertile in all witty Experiments. This Prince lived twelve or fifteen years after the Condemnation of the <hi>Fraticelles;</hi> the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal State was at that time infeſted with Wars, and thoſe Wars hindred his Holineſſes inſpection into Foreign diſorders: The Seat of the Wars having lain ſo long upon <hi>Lombardy,</hi> it was ſo exceedingly depopulated, that it took up all <hi>Dulcinus</hi> his care, to repeople it. He publiſht his Decrees, forbidding all perſons upon pain of death to live Bachelors paſt the age of fourteen. He contributed out of his own Eſtate towards Marriages that were unequal: He granted great Priviledges to Foreigners to inveigle them thither; but <hi>Margaret</hi> his Wife (called in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory the Volupuous) perceiving this new way of repeopling his Country, did withal diminiſh her Husbands Revenue, ſhe bethought her ſelf of a way, as effectual, and not ſo pernicious to the Soveraign. She adviſed <hi>Dulcinus</hi> to grant a general permiſſion to his Subjects to change Husbands and Wives, as they ſhould think it convenient. The advice was judged to be good, and put in Execution immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and the Prince being much pleaſed with the invention of the Princeſs, not only exhibited an Edict of Divorce, as ſhe had counſelled him; but promiſed Sanctuary and Protection to all Strangers which made uſe of that Priviledge. This Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being rumour'd in all the Kingdoms of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:65131:90"/>there was nothing to be ſeen but Navies of people of all Sexes from all Nations coming in daily to eſtabliſh themſelves in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and enjoy the Liberty of that Country: inſomuch that in a ſhort time there wanted Corn for the Inhabitants, though of it ſelf it is one of the moſt fertile Countries in the World: And it being part of the Policy of a Soveraign to give Example in the things he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, the Prince and Princeſs were the firſt which began themſelves to reduce into practice, what they had preacht to other people. Being prudent and juſt, they deſired to know how their Subjects would chuſe, and upon what grounds they would change; and therefore they made themſelves Judges to examine all ſuch as demanded Liberty of Divorce. <hi>Dulcinus,</hi> he interrogated the men about the Complaints they made againſt their Wives, that he might learn by them inclinations of her, whom he deſigned to take in the place of his own Wife; and <hi>Margaret</hi> having the ſame project in her brains in the Examination of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſhe would needs be commiſſioned to hear their Objections. <hi>Dulcinus</hi> was not a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to determine, as to the Accuſations of the Husbands. He found all of them had ſo much reaſon of their ſides, and told their ſtories ſo ſmooth, he could not but ſuſpect the ſincerity of their Informations; he thought it impoſſible there ſhould have been ſo many ill Wives in the whole World, as he found in his Muſter-rolls; and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Wife more tolerable than other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (though ſhe was not without her faults) he concluded he ſhould be forced to ſtick to his firſt
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65131:90"/>Wedding, how ſtrong ſoever his deſire was to a ſeconde. Thoſe which were handſom, were either wanton, or proud; the ill-favour'd were jealous; the witty, imperious and perverſe; the ſober were melancholy: and in ſhort, not a Woman but had ſome quality or other inconſiſtent with the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Society: He conſidered not that none were accuſed before him but ſuch as were defective, and that thoſe Husbands which were contented with their Wives, never came near him for the benefit of his Proclamation. <hi>Margaret</hi> was not in ſuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with her Juriſdiction; whether ſhe was leſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to pleaſe, or that <hi>Dulcinus</hi> his qualities were ſo indifferent, every one ſhe met with had better. But the Princeſs found ſufficient grounds for all the men to plead the Priviledge, though the Prince was reſolved to keep her. He loved a new Wife better than an old one; but he found <hi>Margaret</hi> much better than the reſt. The firſt Woman which was brought before the Princeſs, was a lively brown Laſs, a good preſence, and a ſprightly countenance, her habit was neat, and well contrived, her actions pleaſant, and eaſily diſcerned to be done one pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to pleaſe. You may paſs Miſtreſs, ſays <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> as ſoon as ſhe ſaw her, there is no neceſſity of examining you to know your Complaint. You would have a Gallant, and your Husband will not ſuffer you; you have reaſon indeed to change, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands of that humour are troubleſom, and you ought not to be contented till you meet with one will allow you that liberty. Alas, Madam, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the good Woman, my Husband is none of thoſe, and if I had though one muſt have had occaſion
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65131:91"/>of Complaint againſt their Husband, before ſhe could enjoy the Priviledge of changing, I ſhould ſcarce have troubled your Majeſty or your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at this time. My Husband loves me, he is young, and handſom, not jealous in the leaſt, and I have what Jewels and fine Cloaths I will ask. Why then will you be changing, replied <hi>Margaret</hi> in a huff, for the bare pleaſure of changing? Madam, replied the Woman, do not think it an inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing to break a Chain that muſt otherwiſe hold me as long as I live: did you never obſerve the greateſt Epicures, and thoſe which are uſed to the moſt delicate diſhes, how they will tower and plume themſelves over a <hi>Ragouſt</hi> of Beef? In earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, replied <hi>Margaret,</hi> I ſee we are not all Sots of our Sex, I did not believe the <hi>Capricio</hi> of Change could have been carried ſo far; after which the Princeſs of <hi>Lombardy</hi> decreed that this Woman ſhould be placed at the head of the diſcontented Wives, and that ſhe ſhould have her choice of all the men which ſhould happen to be divorced. From this Examination ſhe proceeded to a ſecond. This was a pale, faint, languiſhing Creature, whoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence in her March proclaimed her naturally lazy. What complaint do you bring againſt your Husband? ſaid <hi>Margaret</hi> to her. Madam, replied poor Pale-face, he loves me too much, he is always kiſſing, and careſſing me, and I can never be at quiet. O cryed <hi>Margaret,</hi> take away this Woman from the reſt, or ſhe will be of very ill Example, and then ſetting down her Husbands name in her Table-book, ſhe would have ſworn he was the man with whom ſhe was her ſelf to put her new
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65131:91"/>Law of Divorce in Execution. She had ſcarce ſet led her ſelf in that reſolution, but in comes a third diſcontent, the paſſion in whoſe face made her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude her Complaint would be quite contrary to the former. What, you are jealous I warrant you? ſaid the Princeſs to her, and you muſt be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of your Husband for his Courtſhip to other Women. I wiſh, Madam, with all my heart, quoth the good Woman, your Majeſty had been a Prophet, I ſhould not have been ſo miſerable as I am; there is nothing (in my Judgment) ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, as to have ſuch a one for ones Husband, he is always neat and perfumed: he is always abroad, and his fear leſt we ſhould pry too far into his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, obliges him to leave the conduct of ours to our ſelves: But alas, Madam, mine is not ſo well diſpoſed, he never ſtirs from home but at <hi>Chriſtmas, Eaſter,</hi> or <hi>Whitſontide,</hi> and judging of my temper by his own, he never ſuffers me one ſtep out of doors, but when he is my Gentleman-Uſher. This good Wife had liberty to change her Husband im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. This being adjudged one of the moſt lawful Cauſes of Divorce that could be alledged. <hi>Margaret</hi> continuing her Office, a Woman crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up into the ſoremoſt Rank, the ſubject of whoſe Complaint was very new, and odd. Her Husband would by all means have her in Love with ſome body elſe, and the poor Woman could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded. It is then becauſe the Gallant your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band propoſed to you, does not pleaſe you? cryed <hi>Margaret.</hi> No, Madam, not ſo, replied the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for he gives me my choice. He tells me, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Women are ſuch Dragons in a houſe, that if I
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65131:92"/>do but rid my ſelf of that good quality, he cares not who it be that deſtroys it. And I muſt confeſs, Madam, my honeſty makes me a little fierce ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; Honour is a Jewel, and when a Woman can once ſay ſhe fears no body, ſhe is ſeldom to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſht in domeſtick Diſputes. My Husband tells me therefore he would have me like other Women, and that a Woman is more tractable and compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, when ſhe hath an amorous Intrigue in her head. But, Madam, I had rather dye a thouſand deaths, than gratifie him in that, my honour is my life, I will do nothing ſhall intrench upon that, and I will ſooner renounce my Marriage, than the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of ſpeaking loud in my own houſe, as all honeſt Women may do. <hi>Margaret</hi> lookt upon this Woman as mad, and made ſigns to have her taken away, without vouchſafing her an Anſwer; and ſhe had reaſon to diſpatch with her as faſt as ſhe could, for ſhe had another attended with ſo much to ſay, that her very ſtory concluded that Audience. It was a <hi>French</hi> Woman, originally of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> but ſo handſom, and charming, the Princeſs her ſelf could not look upon her without admiration. How is it poſſible, ſaid ſhe, any man living ſhould deſire to part with you? The Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger returned her no Anſwer to that; but told her, her accuſation conſiſted of ſo many heads, ſhe humbly beg'd leave to recite her whole ſtory. She was not a perſon to be denied any thing, <hi>Margaret</hi> therefore complied with her Requeſt, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Lady returning thanks for that favour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan her diſcourſe in <hi>Italian</hi> (which ſhe ſpake as it had been her Mother-tongue) in this following manner.</p>

                  <p>I Do not well know where I am to begin, the Deſcription of the Knight and the Lady (which is the uſual beginning of all ſuch Narrations) is improper for me; in reſpect your Highneſs hath me here in your preſence, and my Husband being but in the next Hall with <hi>Dulcinus,</hi> you may ſee him too, if you pleaſe. Nor ſhall I commence with any impertinent Genealogy, it not being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial to your Highneſs who were my Anceſtors, ſo you have but a true Relation of my Affair. I am a Wife, and have a Complaint againſt my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: Hear it I beſeech you with patience, and judge of my Reaſons. I was born in <hi>Montpellier</hi> (a Town very famous for the handſom Women it produces) and my Name is <hi>Mariana Nogaret.</hi> A Gentleman who lived not far off in the Country, having occaſions at <hi>Montpellier,</hi> happened to ſee me by chance, and liked me ſo well, he pretended he loved me. This confidence, not being a thing ſo terrible in our Country, as in other places, I muſt confeſs freely I thought my ſelf very much obliged to him: But the beginnings of our Amour, was of no long duration: for my Servant was called to the Court of <hi>France</hi> upon an Affair not at all impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to this Story; and King <hi>Philip</hi> (ſirnamed <hi>le Bel</hi>) conceived ſo great kindneſs for him, he kept him about his perſon. He gave me notice of the favour he was in, and for ſome time I had reaſon
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65131:93"/>to believe he would not force himſelf to forget me. He writ to me often, and his Letters ſeemed to be paſſionate; but the Court having this in propriety, to forget all former obligations, <hi>Nogaret</hi> by degrees became lazy, and would not write often, and at length neglected it quite. I paſt two whole years without hearing one word of him; but about the third year afterwards, being ſent by the King, his Maſter, to Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> paſſing through <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi> either by accident or deſign he came to <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier.</hi> I may ſay without vanity, had the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that time of being the handſomeſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in that Province; I was grown ſomething fatter than when <hi>Nogaret</hi> firſt ſaw me, my Neck, and proportions were better ſhaped, and <hi>Nogaret</hi> was grown alſo the fineſt Gentleman in <hi>France.</hi> We had no great trouble to revive our old flame, I ſaw nothing in all <hi>Languedoc</hi> to be compared to <hi>Nogaret,</hi> and he ſwore as heartily he had ſeen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi> ſo lovely as my ſelf. The trick of inconſtancy which he had plaid me in his firſt Voyage, made me not relye too much upon his proteſtations then. I remembred he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed as ſtoutly before, and forgot it almoſt as ſoon as out of ſight, but he gave ſo fair pretences for his ſilence, and I had ſo great a deſire they ſhould be true, that I aſſiſted the cheat, and contributed to my own deception. His Fortune and his Duty requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his return, he ſtaid not long at <hi>Montpellier,</hi> but he gave me ſufficient grounds to believe that what he left behind him this time, was much dearer to him than it had been before: He writ to me from all places upon the Road; there was not a faſhion in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65131:93"/>the Court of <hi>France,</hi> but I had the Pattern one of the firſt; and the kindneſs of King <hi>Philip</hi> having raiſed him to a Rank in which he needed not fear being denied, if he demanded me of my Parents, he did it with ſo much ardour, and advantage on my ſide, that he eaſily obtained me. I was conducted to <hi>Lyons,</hi> where <hi>Nogaret</hi> met me, and our Marriage being celebrated there, my new Husband conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to Court with an Equipage more like a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, than a private Train. The King received <hi>Nogaret</hi> with great demonſtrations of Joy; the Queen honoured me with Preſents and Careſſes, and if I had the pleaſure to ſee <hi>Nogaret</hi> outdo all the young Lords of his Age, he had the ſatisfaction to hear his choice commended by every one that ſaw me. Three or four months we continued at this rate, with ſo much felicity and content both to the one and the other, that I cannot think upon that happy time without being melancholy to think it laſted no longer. But, Madam, what I am going to tell you is it to be believed? The firſt tranſports of our Joy was ſcarce paſt, but the names of Husband and Wife became inſupportable to us. <hi>Nogaret</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed daily in Eſteem and Reputation, and I may ſay the air of the Court was no diminution to my Beauty. Had not <hi>Nogaret</hi> been my Husband, I ſhould have had need of my whole ſtock of Vertue to have kept me from loving him more than I ought; and he proteſted had not I been his Wife, he had dyed for Love of me before that; but the indiſpenſable neceſſity of loving one another, gave us continual temptations to hate. We could not be alone together half an hour, but it was trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65131:94"/>if Cuſtom or <hi>Capricio</hi> put us upon any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes, they went againſt the hair, and ſeemed done only to acquit our ſelves of an ungrateful duty that lay upon us, without the leaſt kindneſs or ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the World: Not but that we had a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reſpect one for another, which indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could deſtroy. <hi>Nogaret</hi> lived with me very honourably, and I would have dyed a thouſand deaths before I would have been deficient in my duty to him. But we lookt upon one another as good friends, who being aſſured of one anothers affection, love on, but in a quiet and ſerene kind of way, without the leaſt paſſion or tranſport. This ſort of Civility gives the good Woman all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges her Rank requires of her Husband, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the good man againſt all tempeſts at home. But this is not enough for young Hearts who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſomething further. They would have Love continue with the ſame fervour it began, for (think they) when that which ought to be the effect of Love, is but the effect of Policy and Complacence, Marriage becomes a heavy burden to thoſe who are any thing delicate. Theſe conſiderations rendring us unquiet and moroſe, <hi>Sara Colonne,</hi> one of <hi>Noga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets</hi> particular Friends, began to perceive it. This man was famous over all <hi>Europe</hi> for his irreverences towards Pope <hi>Boniface; Nogaret</hi> had made a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into <hi>Italy</hi> with him, and beſides the familiarity which Travelling produces among Travellers, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna</hi> was a lovely Perſon, and very judicious; he preſt my Husband to let him know the occaſion of his Melancholy, and aſſuring him he ſhould hold his friendſhip ſuſpected for the future, unleſs he
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65131:94"/>vouchſafed him that mark of his affection, he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſht it from him, that it was his diſguſt of me: How, ſays <hi>Colonna,</hi> diſguſted with Madam <hi>Nogaret?</hi> Tell me I beſeech you, do you know any Woman living more handſom and more worthy of your Love than ſhe? 'Tis not of her Beauty I complain, replied my Husband, I muſt confeſs that is great, and any man but a Husband might be happy in it. But tell me, I pray you, of what uſe is that Beauty? of what uſe? replied <hi>Colonna,</hi> for whoſe or for what uſe ſhould your Wife be, but for yours? do you make no difference then betwixt a handſom Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and an ill-favour'd? and if you reſtrain the pleaſures of Matrimony only to the eye, is it not more pleaſant for a Husband when he comes home to find a young, a lively, and neat Woman ready to embrace him, than to be received by a looſe-bodied, mouldy, old Woman? Ha, my dear Friend, replied <hi>Nogaret,</hi> in a ſcornful way, a Wife is always handſom enough, conſidering how little her Husband re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards her. A Man of Honour lives with an ugly Woman as with a handſom, and hath the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of loving a handſomer, if he can find her; whereas when a man hath ſuch a Wife as mine, he ſeems to have loſt his wits when he addreſſes to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Ladies ſend him back again to his Wife, as one he muſt needs know to be handſomer, and ſo he may call upon Saints, and ſwear as many oaths as he pleaſes that he loves her, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her at the laſt. Ha, ſaid he, were I but the Husband of ſuch a Woman (and named one of the uglieſt about the Court) with what pleaſure could I tell Madam <hi>Nogaret</hi> ſhe was the handſomeſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65131:95"/>in the World? She would believe me, becauſe ſhe would know it was true; ſhe would think her ſelf obliged by my commendations, and perhaps recompence them by ſome favour or other: but ſhould I now make this Complement to any other Lady of the Court, ſhe would believe I did but railly; for ſhe knows at her heart Madam <hi>Nogaret</hi> is handſomer. This Dialogue happened in a Hall where we uſually dined: and there being a Grot on one ſide of it, into which after Dinner I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally retired to repoſe my ſelf, it was my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to hear diſtinctly every word they ſaid. I was not at all ſurpriſed at the beginning of their Diſcourſe, had my Judgment been asked in the ſame caſe, I ſhould have ſaid as much of <hi>Nogaret,</hi> as he ſaid of me; but when I heard him wiſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf married to the ugly perſon he named, I could not for my life forbear blurting out into a laughter. <hi>Celonna</hi> thruſt his head into the Grot, to ſee who it was that laught. He found me fitting there alone with a Book in my hand, hearkening with great tranquillity at what paſt betwixt us, as if I had not been concerned in the leaſt; In earneſt, Madam, ſaid he in his turn, this may be called the Houſe of Miracles. The man of all <hi>France</hi> who hath the handſomeſt Wife, wiſhes he had the uglieſt, that he might have the pleaſure of making Love to his own. The Lady of the whole World, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves beſt of her Husband, receives the aſſurance of his diſguſt with a laugh: What kind of Creatures are you two? You, ſays he to <hi>Nogaret,</hi> ſeeing you acknowledge your Wife worthy of your Love, why do you not love her? come into this Grot, and tell
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65131:95"/>me your reaſons? Alas, replied <hi>Nogaret</hi> with a ſmiling diſdain, I have ſo much liberty to ſay what I will to her, that I have nothing to ſay. And you can hear this, and be merry, replied <hi>Colonna,</hi> addreſſing himſelf to me. Why ſhould I not be merry? replied I without any diſorder, is it not a thing pleaſant enough to make my body laugh? Yes without doubt, replied the <hi>Roman,</hi> your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands diſcourſe would make any one laugh, that was indifferent: but I could not have thought, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, you had been under that Character. It is the beſt courſe I can take, replied I, for to ſpeak truth I am ſo much of <hi>Nogarets</hi> mind in all that he hath ſaid, that I cannot in Juſtice condemn him. Come, come away, ſaid my Husband to <hi>Colonna,</hi> taking him by the Elbow, let us take a little Air, you have kept ſuch a ſtir with the names of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife, that the very pronouncing them ſo often, hath given me the headach. As ſoon as he had ſpoke thoſe words, they went forth together, and immediately after my Taylor bringing me home an odd kind of Gown of mine own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar invention, I was pleaſed with it ſo well, I would needs go wait upon the Queen in it, and ſee how ſhe liked it. I met her in the ſtreet, going upon her Devotions, whether I had no mind to follow her, and not having found two or three Ladies at home, which I went to viſit, I reſolved to attend her Majeſties return, in the Garden belonging to the Palace. I had promiſed my Coach to a Friend of mine that Evening; ſo that I diſpatcht that away as ſoon as I was in the Garden; and chuſing the moſt private Walks I could find, I entertained my
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65131:96"/>ſelf with ſolitary thoughts. But, Madam, obſerve I beſeech you, the ſtrangeneſs of my Deſtiny, I was alone, not ſo much as any of my Train at the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den gate, I was maſqued (and in that year which was 1310) they wore their Maſques very little in <hi>France;</hi> by accident my Husband and <hi>Colonna</hi> paſt by the place where I was, and ſeeing me a perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Woman, and walking alone in the Garden, my Husband had a fancy to accoſt me; he had never ſeen that Gown I was in at that time, and he had left me in another when he came out; ſo as not having the leaſt ſuſpicion who I was, he began with a very high Complement about the Excellence of my Shape. This Encounter ſeemed pretty, I had a mind to divert my ſelf with it a little, and diſſembling my voice as much as I could, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be a Lawyers Wife of the Country, who knew nothing of the Court, and ſeconded <hi>Nogarets</hi> miſtake ſo well, that it never came the leaſt into his head, that I was otherwiſe than I told him. He was in a mighty Rapture, nothing but praiſes, and proteſtations in his mouth. He admired ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times my ſhape, ſometimes my Neck, my Hair was the fineſt he ever had ſeen, my Eyes, my Motion, that little he ſaw beneath my Maſque, all excellent, and all inchanted him. <hi>Colonna</hi> thought good to pull him away by the ſleeve, and endeavour to break off a Converſation which he began to be jealous of already; but he could not get him from me, he would follow me to the end of the World he ſwore; and to be ſhort, when he did go away at laſt, he went away the moſt in Love of any man living. <hi>Colonna</hi> lookt upon this Phrenſie with compaſſion,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65131:96"/>I heard him conjure him in <hi>Italian</hi> (which your Ladiſhip perceives I underſtand in ſome meaſure) not to concern himſelf with a Perſon, which for ought he knew might be nothing leſs than what ſhe pretended; that <hi>Paris</hi> was full of ſuch kind of Cattel which pretended highly to Innocence and prudence, though they knew more Roguery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps than they that interrogated them; beſides he would make himſelf ridiculous to the whole Court, if it ſhould be diſcovered he had only ſpoke to the unknown Lady, the little time he had ſpoke to her indeed: but <hi>Nogarets.</hi> Ears were deaf to all ſuch admoniſhments. He would have ſworn by my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion and Meen I was as wiſe, as indeed I was; and being very importunate for liberty to wait upon me home (that he might know where I lived) I had need of all the Authority I began to have over him, to oblige him to excuſe me. I told him I had a jealous Husband at home, who would never ſuffer ſuch perſons as he to enter within his doors; that I could not but judge of the effects I had produced in his heart, by the reſpect he ſhould pay to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; that he ſhould content himſelf with this, that I was not an ungrateful Woman, and that I ſhould find out a way ſome time or other of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his Curioſity more ſecurely. He withdrew upon this, much pleaſed with that hope: and I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found an opportunity to tread upon <hi>Colonna</hi>'s Toe, I ſigned to him that I would ſpeake with him. He followed me to a place I had markt to him with my Eye; and <hi>Nogaret</hi> being too apprehenſive of my diſpleaſure to follow him, he attended at the end of an Alley, very impatient to know what it
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65131:97"/>was I had to ſay to him. When I ſaw my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band at too great a diſtance to underſtand what I ſaid, <hi>Colonna</hi> ſaid I, I am Madam <hi>Nogaret;</hi> he had like to have ſqueakt out at my naming that name, but ſqueezing him by the hand, hold your peace, <hi>Colonna,</hi> ſaid I, this Intrigue is pleaſant enough to be carried on a little further; do you go and find out ſome unknown Coach that may carry me home, and come and fetch me here as ſoon as you can: we will laugh at our leiſure at what is paſt and to come. <hi>Colonna</hi> returned to <hi>Nogaret</hi> with ſo great an inclination to laugh, he had much ado to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; he told my Husband I had inquired who he was, where his Houſe was, and what means I was to uſe to write to him; and having accompanied him to the Kings Appartment, he ſlipt ſuddenly from him, and getting into the firſt of his Friends Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es he could ſee in the Court, he came to find me where he had left me before. This <hi>Roman</hi> was a perfect Friend of my Husbands, and upon any other occaſion but this, I could not have prevailed with him to have engaged in any Treachery againſt <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet:</hi> but he thought he ſhould do him a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable piece of Service, to revive his paſſion for me, and he lookt upon this Intrigue as a way as likely and as innocent as could have poſſibly been thought on. As ſoon as I was got home, I pulled off my new Gown, charged my Women to let no body ſee it, nor to tell any body that ever I had worn it, and having put on that again in which <hi>Nogaret</hi> had left me that morning, I fell into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation with <hi>Colonna,</hi> which way we might ſpin out this Comedy. As to my Husbands neglect, I
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65131:97"/>was abſolutely inſenſible, and I had no deſign to cure him of that by this Stratagem; but I found the ſtory would be pleaſant, and I reſolved to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it to the utmoſt. I had not wit enough to have invented it, but ſince Fortune had been ſo ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I reſolved as much as I could to improve it. <hi>Colonna</hi> incouraged my reſolution, and returning to <hi>Nogaret,</hi> ſaid as many good things on me then, as he had done bad before he knew me. In earneſt, ſaid he, the unknown Lady we ſay in the Garden, is very handſom, I ſee no body at Court hath a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſence, and if what her Mask hides, be as graceful as what it diſcovered, believe me ſhe is the compleateſt Beauty in the World. <hi>Nogaret</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him for his News, as he had told him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had been infinitely for his advantage, and then conjuring his aſſiſtance in the diſcovery who ſhe was, he confeſt he had never been ſo much in Love in his life. I fortified this paſſion by three or four Enterviews, where I muſt needs ſay, I uſed the higheſt of my Skill to triumph over the Errour of my fantaſtical Husband. It was then <hi>Carnaval</hi> time in <hi>France,</hi> in which the <hi>French</hi> run in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies up and down the ſtreets in Maſcarade; and a Peace being concluded about the ſame time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Holineſs and the King of <hi>France,</hi> that year was fuller of Divertiſements than ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before it. The manner in which <hi>Nogaret</hi> and I lived, permitted us not to be often in the ſame deſign, we had each of us our Society, and when he was gone abroad with his Clan, I dreſt my ſelf in Cloaths he did not know, and taking on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one or two of my Women (whom I had injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65131:98"/>ſtrictly to make no mention of my name) I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him from one Company to another, to add new ſmart to his old Wound, if it were poſſible, The alteration a Mask gives to the voice, deſguiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mine ſo well, that <hi>Nogaret</hi> never ſuſpected me for any body, but the unknown Lady in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and under that quality I could not ſpeak one word but inchanted him. He conjured me by all that he could imagine might prevail, to give him an opportunity of waiting upon me at home, but he remembred the jealous Husband I had mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our firſt Conference, and that brought me off there; and when from his Propoſition of Viſits, he was come ſo low, as to be contented with the bare ſight of me now and then: I told him I had no great confidence in Courtiers, and I would have a little further Experience, before I would diſcover my ſelf, that if he perſiſted in his earneſtneſs to ſee me, or attempted to have me dogg'd, I would leave my Houſe the next day, and conceal my ſelf ſo well for the future, he ſhould give me over for loſt. This fear kept him in the temper I would have him; but to requite his Compliance, I ſent him ſeveral Letters, which <hi>Colonna</hi> cauſed to be tranſcribed, and I received ſeveral of his Anſwers. I remember theſe Letters were the production of a very pretty Adventure. <hi>Nogaret</hi> had loſt one of mine, and what I had ſaid to him of the Jealouſie of my Husband, making him apprehenſive, leſt it ſhould be found by any body that knew the Hand, he contrived a pleaſant way to evade that inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience. He cauſed ſeveral Notes to be written in ſeveral Characters, and when he had done, ſtole
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65131:98"/>them into the Pockets of the moſt conſiderable Courtiers; I cannot tell you, Madam, what trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this Whimſey brought into the Court; all theſe Tickets were of Love, ſome calm and ſmooth, others high and outragious; ſome were full of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, others of Thanks, but all of them Aſſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo that there was nothing to be ſeen in the Walks but Gallants with Tickets in their hands, attending their Miſtreſſes, and this produced many Quarrels and ſeveral Divorces. There was a great ſtir made to diſcover from whence they came, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a Ticket came from ſuch a man, or from ſuch a Woman, and the moſt expert perſons in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters were ſent to reſolve them. To ſay the truth, had this Intrigue betwixt <hi>Nogaret</hi> and me had any thing of reality, that Artifice would have been uſeful, for the Note he loſt was found by one of his young Coxcombs, who (having ſeen it fall out of <hi>Nogarets</hi> Pocket, and finding it treated of Love) brought it to me, in hopes (as I ſuppoſe) to have drawn ſome advantage to himſelf, by my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands indiſcretion. I laught heartily when I ſaw the Note, and his action who brought it: I thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for his Service, pretending it very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and running to <hi>Nogarets</hi> Chamber, Here, my Lord, ſaid I, tendring him the Note, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting my ſelf mightily jealous, have a better care of your Love-Letters another time: So here is one fell out of your Pocket in very good Company, and it is not like a perſon of your diſcretion, ſuffer ſuch Letters as theſe to run up and down the World. <hi>Nogaret</hi> bluſht at the ſight of that Letter, but the Trick he had plaid ſupplied him readily
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65131:99"/>with an excuſe, I'le lay my life, ſays he, this is one of the Letters, have been ſo ſlyly ſtollen into all the Pockets at Court, and then opening it as he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen it before, he read theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yes, Brave Sir, I believe I may be beloved, my Beauty is ſufficient to convince me of that, without other Arguments, my Charms I am better acquainted with than you, and therefore cannot but doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one can love what he hath never ſeen. As for you, it is no extraordinary thing that I ſhould love you, I know who you are, I ſee you undiſguiſed every day; but how can you tell but that which is concealed by my Mask, may put you out of conceit again with all you have ſeen. Women are the greateſt Impoſtures in the World, and perhaps in the ſame moment you love me ſo ardently without knowing me, I may become the Perſon the moſt indifferent to you of all the Sex, if you did know me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Without diſſembling, Madam, cryed <hi>Nogaret,</hi> after he had read it, this is a pleaſant Letter, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be real or counterfeit, the Perſon who writ it hath a great deal of Wit. I had like to have burſt out a laughing at <hi>Nogarets</hi> Character, but not being as yet weary of ſo pretty a Divertiſement, I forced my ſelf, and replied without any emotion; What is it you ſee ſo extraordinary in this Letter? What is it do you ask? replied my Husband, why is it all, Madam, the ſenſe, the model, the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the neatneſs of the thoughts. Certainly, ſaid I, (with as much eagerneſs as he) I ſee nothing in it but very common. I do not pretend to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:65131:99"/>Secretary, yet I dare lay a Wager I will write as well as that when I pleaſe. <hi>Nogaret</hi> lookt upon me with a diſdain, had like to have put me out of Countenance, and lifting up his eyes and ſhoulders, as if he pitied my vanity, he judged it ſo idle that I had ſaid, he vouchſafed me not an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. He went forth immediately (without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word) in queſt of his dear <hi>Colonna</hi> to give him an account of what had paſt. I had many of theſe Regales from him while the Carnaval laſted; but that growing near to an end, &amp; <hi>Nogaret</hi> preſſing daily for ſome eaſe of his Martyrdom, as he called it, I reſolved to put an end to this Comedy, and give him a ſight of me; I appointed him a meeting at a Country-houſe about a League out of the City, where I told him I had got leave of my Husband to retire for ſome days. He had like to have dyed with Joy at the News, he gript my hand with ſo great tranſportation, he forgot he hurt me, and from the night in which I gave him that aſſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the day he was to meet, he took ſo little reſt, I began to pity him. He was in a perpetual trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, changed his place every quarter of an hour, and I underſtood by his Servants he ſlept not a wink: but at length the deſired day arrived. <hi>Nogaret</hi> by agreement was not to come to the <hi>Rendez-vous</hi> till after Sun-ſet, and yet he came into my Chamber in the morning before day ready dreſt. I pretended to admire his diligence, and askt him what might be the cauſe. He told me he was to receive an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the King to be executed by him, and that in expectation of that, he was to be ready all day. This invention made me ſmile, and being willing
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:65131:100"/>to put my Prevaricator to it, as much as I could, I askt him, Will this Order hinder you from ſupping to night with a certain Friend of ours, to whoſe Houſe I have ingaged to bring you along with me. Yes doubtleſs, replied <hi>Nogaret</hi> a little haſtily, it will hinder me; for perhaps it will be night before I can execute it. Alas, ſaid I, and how comes it to paſs you dreſs your ſelf before day, for an Affair which you believe cannot be diſpatcht before night. You know my exactneſs, replied my Diſſembler, in what relates to my duty to my Maſter, I had rather be ready twelve hours too ſoon, than have his buſineſs ſtay for me one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Good my Lord, replied I, taking him by the hand, be of my Company to night, let me conjure you, I do not often trouble you with importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but I muſt needs tell you, you will diſoblige me exceedingly, if you refuſe me this time. <hi>Noga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> had always carried himſelf with great reſpect towards me, when under the name of the Country Lawyers Wife, I deſired to know his opinion of his own, he ſtill ſtopt my mouth, and told me, that was Sacred, and not to be diſcovered. I confeſs I have no great paſſion for her my ſelf; but I have ſo much eſteem for her, I would dye a thouſand deaths before any body ſhould ſpeak ill of her, and for me to ſpeak well of her, I ſuppoſe is none of your deſign. This moderate Husband of mine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving denied me a thing I had ſo inſtantly requeſted, he diſguiſed his refuſal with the beſt reaſons he could think on; but all that would not diſcourage me, I kiſſed him, I careſſed him, I upbraided him, and deſired this Compliance as the only thing I
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65131:100"/>would ever ask him again. Alas, I expected not he ſhould promiſe me, I knew as well as he what obliged him to the contrary, but it pleaſed me not a little, to give him this diſquiet as a puniſhment for his contempt of me. To be ſhort, in ſpight of my Complaints, in ſpight of my Reproaches, away he went in order to his aſſignation, and that no man might take notice of his Journey, he would not have a Horſe of his own, but took a Hackney in a by-place of the City, and without any of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants with him, away he went towards the Houſe where I had appointed him to meet. I was got thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome hours before him: for beſides that he was not to come before night, and I went from home preſently after Dinner; he had an unluckly Accident by the way, which gave him a ſtop. He was very ill mounted, and the hopes he was in, imploying his thoughts ſo much, he regarded not which way his Horſe went, it was late, as I have obſerved, and about the beginning of <hi>Lent:</hi> ſo that the darkneſs, and duſt concurring, his Horſe lead him fairly into a Slough, from whence he had much ado to diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himſelf. Had this Accident happened to an ordinary Lover, there had been no great matter in it, Love takes delight many times to ſport it ſelf with the impatience of Lovers: but to have it happen to a Husband, going to an Appointment with his own Wife, and this Lady he ſollicited with ſo much zeal (without knowing her) and went to meet in deſpight of ſo many dangers and impediments, to be daily at his diſpoſing in his own houſe, was ſo pleaſant a thing, perhaps the like never happened before. Poor <hi>Nogaret</hi> finding
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65131:101"/>himſelf in a ſtinking Bog, upon an inſenſible Jade, which deſpiſed the correction both of his hand and his heel, made a thouſand vows and obſecrations to Love to deliver him out of ſo villanous a place. He thought once to have alighted off his Horſe, and tryed to have diſengaged himſelf on foot, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the Slough was deep and muddy, he had but one pair of Breeches about him, and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to defile them in ſuch an Adventure. He kickt, he ſpur'd, he ſwore, he repined, but he might have kickt, and ſwore, and repined long enough, had not the officious <hi>Colonna</hi> come in luckily to his aſſiſtance. This good man (imagining very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, that this Intrigue betwixt <hi>Nogaret</hi> and me could not probably be diſcovered without ſome kind of diſpleaſure) came to prevent by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence any ill conſequence that might ariſe. The Moon was up, and <hi>Nogaret</hi> knew him by the light of it, he cryed out to have him come to him, and being come; Ah, my dear Friend, ſaid he to him (with a voice trembling betwixt choler and cold) help me, I beſeech you, I can do no more, I have been two long hours in this Slough, and without your aſſiſtance I am like to be here all night. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna</hi> knew him, and ſeeing him in ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for an Enterpriſe which deſerved better luck, as ſo pleaſed with the Adventure, that he could not anſwer him for laughing. How, ſaid <hi>Nogaret</hi> to him in a rage, is it thus you relieve your Friend at a time when he hath ſo much need of your aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? What aſſiſtance would you have? replied <hi>Colonna,</hi> laughing all the while: I am neither Ploughman, nor Mariner, and it would require all
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65131:101"/>the Altars both of the one and the other to fetch you off where you are: What in Gods name do you there? who conducted you? and how came you to march alone in the night, without any Servants, and upon an ugly Jade that is none of your own? We will ſatisfie you to thoſe queſtions hereafter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Nogaret,</hi> much diſcompoſed both with anger and ſhame: this is no time for ſuch Narratives as thoſe, but do what you can to deliver me, I beſeech you. <hi>Colonna</hi> alighted, took his Hackney by the Bridle, ſpoke to him, and batter'd the Beaſt, till at laſt with much ado he got him to a place where <hi>Nogaret</hi> might throw himſelf off on his back upon the ground. When he was landed, they marcht together to the next Village, where my poor Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was ſcraped and made clean, and <hi>Colonna</hi> ſent out to get another Horſe for him, for his old Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was dying. But my Husbands impatience not giving him leave to attend the hiring of a new one, he leapt up upon <hi>Colonna</hi>'s, and rid away full ſpeed to the place of the Aſſignation. I was in Bed when he arrived, foreſeeing the hour paſt, and not daring to venture back to <hi>Paris</hi> in the night, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to lye where I was, being aſſured I could juſtifie my abſence, if it ſhould be required. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garets</hi> tranſport was ſo great, when he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone in my Chamber, that he did not think of bringing the Candle with him to my Bed-ſide. He threw himſelf upon his knees, and taking me by the hand, he kiſſed it with ſo much joy and affection, I was afraid he had been mad. I confeſs I began to be troubled at his miſtake, and ſhould have thought my ſelf much indebted to Fortune, had ſhe done
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65131:102"/>that in my favour, which ſhe had done in his. I would not have committed a Crime, but I could have wiſht ſome Inchantment like my Husbands had communicated to me as much pleaſure in his Careſſes, as he received in beſtowing them. He threw himſelf upon the Bed, embraced my knees through the Counterpane, and gave me a thouſand thanks for my goodneſs in the beſt Language his Love could ſuggeſt. But when after his firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of trouble and tranſport, he came to draw the Curtains quite and in the unknown Perſon he ſo tenderly loved, he diſcovered the ſame Woman he ſo long had deſpiſed. He ſwore a great oath, I think in my Conſcience 'tis my Wife, and ſtepping a little back to inform himſelf better, he fell down under the Chairs, ſo amazed at his Adventure, I feared he would never have recovered. No, Sir, ſaid I, it is none but your Wife, you ſee how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous it is to commit your ſelf to the conduct of your heart, you would never have ſuſpected yours to have been guilty of this miſtake: <hi>Mariana</hi> is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to you under the Name of Madam <hi>Noga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi> that you could not think ſhe could charm you in another ſhape. I am nevertheleſs the Lady in the Mask you were ſo taken with in the Garden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Palace. This Shape, theſe Eyes, this Neck: in ſhort, all this Perſon you ſo paſſionately deſired when unknown, is the very ſame you lookt upon ſo diſdainfully now you know me. I ſent you word in the Letter you loſt, that your paſſion would be over as ſoon as you ſaw me. I know not whether <hi>nogaret,</hi> overlaid with theſe reproache, was not able to endure them any longer, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65131:102"/>ther his indignation for being deceived, augmented the horrour he expreſt at the ſight of me, but he ran down ſtairs as faſt as he could, and calling for his Horſe, away he went for <hi>Paris</hi> with all ſpeed, as ill ſatisfied now with his Aſſignation, as he ever had been pleaſed. He was ſcarce gone a moment, but <hi>Colonna</hi> came in, I told him what had paſt at our Enterview, and I underſtood from him what had befallen <hi>Nogaret</hi> by the way. I could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear laughing for my heart, when I fancied him in the Puddle; but my kindneſs returning after a time, I diſpatcht <hi>Colonna</hi> after him, leſt ſome new Accident might befal him. I lookt upon all this Accident as a JeſT, and I did hope <hi>Nogaret</hi> would have lookt upon it no otherwiſe, but I was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in my opinion. He was ſo much inraged at the fallacy, that he hath not forgiven me to this day. <hi>Colonna</hi> thought good to let him know, that it was Fortune which began it, and that if either of us had reaſon to complain of the Conſequence, it was certainly I. He replied to his remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that I was an Impoſture, and that a Woman which could diſguiſe her ſelf ſo well, would act the greateſt and moſt horrible diſloyalties, when-ever ſhe had a mind to it. Seeing then I could not mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life him by any means, I cauſed it to be propoſed to him to come hither and implore that Priviledge you ſo graciouſly are pleaſed to afford all ſuch Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands as are diſſatisfied with their Wives. The Coundition he ſtood in, in <hi>France,</hi> made him averſe at firſt, but the good men which think themſelves burdened with their Wives, fancy nothing imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65131:103"/>upon theſe terms, and are now preſent in your Court. But ſee, Madam, and admire the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of my Stars, the liberty I now enjoy of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Nogaret,</hi> makes me begin to think our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration inſupportable. I beſeech you therefore, moſt Excellent Princeſs, continued <hi>Mariana</hi> (throwing her ſelf at <hi>Margarets</hi> feet) obtain of <hi>Duleinus</hi> in my behalf, that <hi>Nogaret</hi> may not have that permiſſion, which I know he demands. As I imitated him in his diſguſt, it is poſſible he may do as much for me in my return. The neceſſity of our Loves begat our Antipathy, and who knows but the liberty to hate may revive our affections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mariana</hi> was not out of the way, when ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this manner. She had ſcarce ended her Petition, but <hi>Dulcinus</hi> came in to deſire <hi>Margaret,</hi> in the behalf of <hi>Nogaret,</hi> to grant to ſuch permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Mariana.</hi> In ſhort, this Couple took one another again, and loved one another as entirely, as when they were married at firſt. Their Example was ſo good, that being followed by ſeveral others, it carried many a good man and his Wife back again into <hi>France,</hi> who renounced the Priviledge of Divorce, and demonſtrated to the World, That liberty to change takes away the deſire to do it. That did well, and like wiſe men to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo, they would have been conſtrained other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by force, to what they did willingly: for Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Fifth (having intelligence of what paſt in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and finding this new Law inconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Laws of Chriſtianity) raiſed a ſtrong Army, and ſent it againſt <hi>Dulcinus,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a Legat, his Nephew. The Legat over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65131:103"/>him, forced him to renounce his Errour, and reſcued his Subjects from that Libertiniſm in which they began to be plunged.</p>

                  <p>Whilſt <hi>Margaret</hi> was bewailing the ſucceſs of the Legat, and ſome Husbands (apprehending the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of that War) haſted very prudently to gain the benefit of that Priviledge. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> applied himſelf to the Eſtabliſhment of that Cuſtom in his Kingdom, which was ſo unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately ſuppreſt in <hi>Lombardy.</hi> He had ſent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours into <hi>France</hi> to negotiate a Marriage for him with <hi>Blanche,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Peter</hi> Duke of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> a near Kinſman to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> the firſt King of <hi>France</hi> of that Race. The <hi>Caſtillians</hi> are a flegmatick people in matters of Negotiation, and thoſe whom <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had imployed about this, driving at the advantage of the Kingdom, more than the particular intereſt of the King, they were ſo tedious in concluding upon their Conditions, that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> began to be weary of their delay. He was as violent as they were cautious, when he ſent to make that Overture about <hi>Blanche,</hi> he had prepared his patience for no longer expectation than was neceſſary for a Journey betwixt <hi>Burgos</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> and finding that elapſed, and no intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when the Wife was to come, he began to think of eaſing his impatience by ſome gentle diverſion,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65131:104"/>(for by that name it is all beginnings of Love are Chriſtned) that which makes oftentimes the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affair of a mans life, is lookt upon at firſt but as a tranſitory fancy, and whilſt one thinks but to play and dally with Love as with a Child, the leaſt of his ſcratches become incurable and mortal. At this rate it happened to our young Monarch. He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his inclinations to <hi>Nugnez de Prade</hi> Grand Maſter of the Order of <hi>Callatrava,</hi> and the chief of his Favourites. Such kind of Confidences as theſe, are not very honourable in themſelves, but the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ennobles them. It is always good to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Secrets of ones Maſter, let the part he be to act be what it will. <hi>Nugnez</hi> thought himſelf much honoured that the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> had made choice of him to ſerve him in his Amours, and to acquit himſelf honourably of his Truſt, he gave himſelf up entirely to the finding out a Miſtreſs for <hi>Don Pedro.</hi> This is an imployment which requires no great trouble, Ladies are generally very well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, when they are deſired for a Prince: but <hi>Nugnez</hi> could not accommodate with all that was offered him. He was as dutiful a Subject, as he was a dextrous Sollicitor; and not being willing give the King any more than a bare diverſion, it coſt him ſome trouble to find out a Perſon handſome enough to pleaſe him, and yet not ſo compleat as to work him into a paſſion. He thought he had met with one according to his mind, in the perſon of <hi>Maria de Padilla,</hi> one of the Maids of Honour to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Albuquerque.</hi> This young Lady was witty and lively, ſhe was young and handſom, and though ſhe was neither of Beauty nor Quality
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65131:104"/>ſufficient to give any obſtruction to the Marriage intended; yet ſhe was well enough to ſatisfie his impatience till the Princeſs arrived. To relate the Formalities of our Monarch towards this Virgin, or the Virgins to the King, would be to charge our Annals with an impertinent Circumſtance. Lovers of <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Rank, are not ſubiect to the Puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioes of a Romance. They carry their Miſtreſſes by abſolute Power, and it is not for them the Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms were deviſed. <hi>Nugnez</hi> told <hi>Padilla,</hi> the King likes you very well; and <hi>Padilla</hi> replied, What will his Majeſty command me? but this bargain made with ſo much expedition, and conſummated with ſo much eaſe, had not a concluſion ſuitable to its beginning. <hi>Padilla</hi> had athouſand qualities capable of making a Lover happy, more than indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſons could diſcern. The vivacity of her Wit animated all her actions, her humour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency ſupplied the defects of her Beauty; and the Kings Magnificence making her eminent for a natural inclination to neatneſs; <hi>Don Pedro</hi> at the very firſt found that his Miſtreſs, which the Grand Maſter hoped he would never have diſcovered. He preſt his Embaſſadours no more to diſpatch; and the little concern he had for her return, making him think it precipitate when they did, he ſcarce believed the Princeſs was come out of <hi>Paris,</hi> when advice was brought that ſome body was to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to receive her upon the Frontiers. Theſe tydings both ſurpriſed and afflicted him. He could have wiſht never to have heard it whilſt he lived; but the Marriage of Kings being no jeſting matter, there was a neceſſity that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> ſhould
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65131:105"/>pretend to be content. He diſpatcht <hi>Nugnez de Prade</hi> to attend the new Queen, and advancing himſelf ſome three days Journey from <hi>Burgos,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to meet her, he reſolved to content himſelf in this buſineſs as well as he could; but his Love for <hi>Padilla</hi> would by no means concur: her abſence, though but for three days, ſeemed an Age to him. He muſt needs return to her, he could not endure the thoughts of marrying <hi>Blanche,</hi> and looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his lawful duty, as a deſertion of his Miſtreſs, he left the new Queen to ſhift for her ſelf, and returned to his <hi>Padilla</hi> for conſolation. When <hi>Nugnez</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the King had given Order for his Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page to march back towards <hi>Burgos,</hi> he thought he had been miſinformed, replied immediately to his Majeſty, and finding him ready to take Horſe, Why Sir, ſaid he, in great aſtoniſhment, will you quit our new Queen before you ſee her? Conſider I beſeech you, you are but a days Journey from her? I know not, replied <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> whether that be enough for her, but I am ſure 'tis too much for me. Is it, Sir, replied the Grand Maſter, that you have not found her as you had reaſon to have hoped, or that ill inſtructed in the obedience ſhe owes you, ſhe hath?—No, <hi>Nugnez,</hi> replied <hi>Don Pedro</hi> interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting him, 'tis nothing of all that; 'tis only this, <hi>Don Pedro of Caſtile</hi> is not born for <hi>Blanche de Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon:</hi> Thoſe who contrived this Meeting, knew neither of us both; and tob e ſhort, ſhe may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>France</hi> as ſhe came, if her deſign be to be Queen of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> for ſhe is nothing to me now, and never will be more. The faithful <hi>Nugnez</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed exceedingly with this reſolution, did
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65131:105"/>what he could to make <hi>Don Pedro</hi> conſider of what importance it might be: he repreſented the Power of the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> by the acceſſion of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Valois</hi> to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> the general intereſt of all Princes to vindicate an Affront to a Princeſs, ſo nearly related to the moſt Puiſſant of all the Chriſtian Kings, the diſſatisfaction of the Apoll ſtolick See, the murmures of the people, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury he would do to his own Honour and Renown; but all theſe remonſtances were in vain. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> departed without vouchſafing the Grand Maſter an Anſwer, leaving him to repent at leiſure what-ever e had recommended <hi>Padilla</hi> to be Miſtreſs to the King. This faithful Favourite beholding at one Proſpect the evils which this action would bring upon <hi>Caſtile,</hi> reſolved as much as he could to divert it, by cajolling the new Queen. He prepared an eloquent Diſcourſe to excuſe her Entertainment, and after he had peruſed it, and was well ſatisfied with the Contents, he deſired Audience of <hi>Blanche,</hi> and endeavoured what he could to juſtifie <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro.</hi> He pretended indiſpoſition of body, and ſome imaginary Affairs of State to apologize for his departure; but there was no need he ſhould trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf ſo far. <hi>Blanche</hi> was a Princeſs but of ſmall Experience in the World, ſhe had been brought up in a Monaſtery, where they make a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of opening their very Eyes, and ſhe believed it was ſufficient to have been married by <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Ambaſſadours to make her Queen of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> When <hi>Nugnez</hi> perceived this Errour, he was very much ſurpriſed. The King had given him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Marriage was not conſummate, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65131:106"/>to ſee the Princeſs, mortally diſſatisfied with her miſtaken, and upon this point it was his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue was principally to inſiſt: but whatever he could ſay to explain himſelf, and what addreſs ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he uſed to eradicate that opinion out of <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi> (reſerving the reſpect he ought to her Perſon) he found her invincibly perſwaded ſhe was <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Wife already, and ſhe bluſht when ſhe ſaid it, as much as another Woman would have bluſht at a far greater Crime. So profound an ignorance is rare in a Perſon of her Age; <hi>Nugnez</hi> could not contemplate it without aſtoniſhment, and adding pity to his wonder, by degrees both the one and the other produced ſparkles of Love, which brake out at length into a moſt pernicious flame. <hi>Blanche</hi> was young, and of an excellent humour, and to be handſom, ſhe wanted nothing but a deſireto pleaſe, inſomuch as our Grand Maſter fell in Love at a time when it was leaſt ſuſpected, and with the Perſon in the World he had the leaſt deſign upon. In brief, his fidelity to his Maſter ſeemedto have ſhut up all the avenues of his heart againſt ſo crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal a paſſion: never was Subject more zealous for his Prince, and he had given a thouſand inſtances of his affection. But what is it that Love cannot do? <hi>nugnez</hi> found Charms in the Innocence of <hi>Blanche,</hi> which <hi>Don Pedro</hi> lookt upon as faults; he took no pleaſurebut in the Company of the Princeſs, and the pretence of perſwading his Majeſtyto his duty, giving him opportunity of frequent and long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences with the King, his paſſion increaſedſo faſt by occaſion of thoſe Enterviews, he had ſcarce pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to diſſemble it. Had he conſulted his own
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65131:106"/>heart about the ſucceſsof his Negotiation, he would have done what he could poſſibly to have cauſed it to miſcarry. Which way ſoever he lookt upon the Kings averſion for <hi>Blanche,</hi> it could not be but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to <hi>nugnez.</hi> Firſt it threatned <hi>Caſtile</hi> with a dangerous War, and the Grand Maſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chief Miniſter, that Menace muſt needs be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him. Moreover it furniſht the Courtiers with an opportunity of flattery, of which a Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite may make a marvellous uſe, and if his Policy accommodated with this Divorce, the Reader may eaſily believe his Love would not be againſt it. But this generous <hi>Caſtillian</hi> (being in reality more a Perſon of Honour than a Lover, or intereſted Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) did as much to reduce his Maſter to what was juſt, as he had been to have received no advantage by his pertinacity. He conferred with the Duke of <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> Husband to <hi>Phidilla</hi>'s old Miſtreſs, and <hi>Nugnez</hi> particular Friend. The misfortune this Duke conceived it to have brought up the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his Houſe, who was like to be the deſtruction of the Royal Family of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> made him more paſſionate for the intereſts of <hi>Blanche,</hi> than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Grandees in that Kingdom. They went together to <hi>Padilla,</hi> they deſired her (as Friends) that ſhe wouldimploy all her Wit and Capacity with the King, to prevail with him to uſe <hi>Blanche</hi> as he was in duty obliged; but perceiving that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title of Friends they were not regarded, they changed their Character, they began to ſpeak with authority, and threatned her with the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Kingdom, if ſhe ſtopt not the courſe of an injuſtice, of which ſhe was lookt upon
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65131:107"/>as the Author. <hi>Padilla</hi> was proud and witty, ſhe diſcovered by the conſequence how much ſhe was nettled at this threat; but thinking that no time to hint her diſpleaſure, ſhe promiſed the Duke and the Grand Maſter ſhe would contribute her utmoſt to <hi>Blanches</hi> ſatisfaction. But ſhe had a care of being as good as her word; ſhe had too much pride and ambition to make any ſerious prayers ſo contrary to her vanity and her hopes. Nevertheleſs the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> (not being able to endure ſuch an injury to their Nation, as the violation of their Faith ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly engaged by publick Authority, and the moſt confident perſons amongſt them) murmured high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the injuſtice of it. The Grandees fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Cabals, the Common-people into Factions, all things were tending to a Revolt. <hi>Leonora</hi> Queen Dowager of <hi>Arragon, Don Pedro</hi>'s Aunt, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the danger he was in, took the liberty to admoniſh her Nephew. She was eminent for her Courage, and is commended in Hiſtory for her Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence above the reſt of her Sex. She repreſented to this Monarch the deplorable Eſtate into which his Crown was running, unleſs he would obſerve at leaſt ſome appearances of Honour and Juſtice with his Wife; and the property of Rhetorick being to give the ſtrongeſt and moſt ſpecious colours one can invent, to the evils he would avert, <hi>Leonora</hi> knew ſo well to delineate the misfortunes which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> that he thought them already upon his ſhoulders. He was a violent Prince, of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ferocity, to whom Poſterity afterwards gave the firname of Cruel. As ſoon as the Queen his Aunt was departed, he ſent immediately for <hi>Nug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nez</hi>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:65131:107"/>and having intimated his reſentment againſt the Rebels, he told him that he found there was a neceſſity of preventing the Rebellion, and that the moſt probable was was by taking away the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and removing <hi>Blanche</hi> into another World: that he was reſolved to have her poyſoned, and that knowing the zeal and fidelity the Grand Maſter had for his Service, he had pitcht upon him for that Execution. If ever any Favourite in Love hath received from his Maſter Commiſſion to murder his Miſtreſs, he will eaſily comprehend how much <hi>Nug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nez</hi> was delighted with this Diſcourſe. He loved the King ſo entirely, he would rather have dyed a thouſand deaths than have betrayed him; and he loved <hi>Blanche</hi> with a paſſion as violent as pure, and he loved only for Loves ſake. When he conſidered <hi>Don Pedro</hi> as a moſt puiſſant Monarch, who honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him hourly with his particular favours, he thought he could not obey his Orders too ſoon. When he reflected upon <hi>Blanche</hi> as an innocent Princeſs, deſerving none of her misfortunes, and one he loved as his ſoul, he knew nothing ſo Sacred which he would not immolate to her ſafety. This perplexity having taken away his ſpeech, the King asked him in an anger, if he was grown dumb ſince he came into his Cloſet. I wiſh, Sir, with all my heart, replied <hi>Nugnez,</hi> I were dumb indeed, I ſhould then be excuſed for not anſwering the moſt ſtrange, and to me the moſt cruel diſcourſe I ever heard in my life. Why Sir? ſaid he with his eyes faſt fixt upon the King, will you take away the life of a Princeſs, who is guilty of no Crime, but not being ſo happy as to pleaſe you, and ſupports that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65131:108"/>with ſo much ſubmiſſion, her very patience ought to make your Majeſty kinder! Do you call that ſubmiſſion, replied the King, interrupting him haſtily, to form parties and publiſh remonſtrances againſt me every day. I can no ſooner ſtir out of my Palace, but I am aſſaulted by the Clamours of my people, crying out mutinouſly for their Queen. The Grandees of my Kingdom ſollicite me perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually. The Queen my Aunt could not forbear denouncing of miſchief. Would you have me ſit ſtill, and expect the Rebellion of my Subject with patience, and imprudently expoſing my ſelf to the indignation of the <hi>French,</hi> give my ſelf up to the fury of my incenſed Wife. No, Sir, replied <hi>Nug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nez,</hi> I would have none of that: I would ſooner dye than entertain one thought into my Soul, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your ſafety and your Kingdoms; and though I would ſpend every drop of my own, for the preſervation of the Queens blood, yet I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to let out that too, if your Majeſty commands it. But I beſeech you, Sir, continued the Grand Maſter, throwing himſelf at the Kings feet, look upon the Conſequences before you command me. <hi>Blanche</hi> is not one of your Majeſties Subjects, which you have advanced to your Throne by the meer motion of your goodneſs: ſhe is illuſtrious for her Birth, for her Vertue, and nearly related to one of the greateſt Kings in <hi>Europe.</hi> What does your Majeſty think this great Monarch and his Allies will do, if he ſuſpects you have made away a Princeſs of his own Blood, which upon your ſolemn ſollicitation he had given you for a Wife? Again, Sir, had not all formal Complacencies been denied, it had been
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65131:108"/>poſſible a violent death might have paſt for natural; but who do you think, I beſeech you, will doubt of the truth, after the Treatment the unhappy Princeſs hath received from you. They would believe you, Sir, in great favour with Deſtiny, ſhould they ſee you delivered ſo ſeaſonably from a Wife you ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, without contributing any more to her death, than your bare deſires. No, Sir, believe me, I beſeech you, there will not be a perſon living but will conclude you joyned your endeavours to your good wiſhes; and this opinion being once ſetled (as ſetled it will doubtleſs be) I leave it with all humility to your Judgment to conſider what conſequences it will produce. But what would you have me do then, replied <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> to ſecure my ſelf againſt the perils to which our Divorce will expoſe me: for to live honourably with <hi>Blanche</hi> is more than I can do; I have an Antipathy againſt her which I cannot maſter, all her actions diſpleaſe me, and I love <hi>Padilla</hi> even to adoration. Had I but either my Love or averſion to contend with, I might perhaps overcome one of them; but to combate them both at a time, and not content to tear a violent paſſion out of my heart, but I muſt undertake to put a perſon I hate naturally into its place, is a thing, my good <hi>Nugnez,</hi> I am not able to do. This, Sir, replied <hi>Nugnez,</hi> would not perhaps be ſo difficult to another, as it is to you. The For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities which <hi>Hymen</hi> requires of a wiſe Husband, are not ſo incompatible with a foreign Amour; but ſeeing an accommodation which ſo many Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands find eaſie, ſeems ſo impoſſible to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, enjoy your <hi>Padilla,</hi> and no other, your will
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65131:109"/>ought to be our Law, and it is not for Subjects to expoſtulate againſt the deſires of their Sovereigns. But, Sir, content your ſelf, I beſeech you, with that liberty, and be not ſo far tranſported, as to diſpoſe of a life the Heavens have not ſubjected to your power. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> replied, if I do not immolate her life to the ſecurity of my own, I am in danger of having mine ſacrificed to the indignation of the <hi>French.</hi> Can you think ſo warlike and ſo potent a Nation can digeſt my treatment of <hi>Blanche,</hi> without attempting ſome thing to revenge it? And will they be more backward, think you, Sir, replied <hi>Nugnez,</hi> when they ſuſpect you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed her? The manner of her death will be doubtful, replied <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> which my averſion for her is not. Beſides they may have hopes of forcing me to marry her whilſt the Princeſs is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, of which ſhe being dead, they muſt be deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of courſe. To maladies that are curable, reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are properly to be applied, but no body inquires after any for a man that is irrecoverable. In ſhort, <hi>Nugnez,</hi> 'tis to no purpoſe to argue in a thing that is reſolved. I will rid my ſelf of <hi>Blanche,</hi> and if you deny me your aſſiſtance, I ſhall find others of my Subjects more zealous for my Service, and not ſo ſcrupulous, who will think it an honour to receive that Commiſſion from my own mouth. <hi>Nugnez</hi> perceiving the King to be angry, and apprehending leſt he ſhould be really as good as his word, and give his Orders to ſome other perſon who would be more readily diſpoſed to execute them than he: he pretended to be overcome with his reaſons, and promiſed him to rid him of the Queen. But, Sir
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65131:109"/>ſaid he, ſuffer me, I beſeech you, to do it my own way, and at my own leiſure; do not precipitate an affair ſo well worthy of deliberation. We muſt firſt drive the <hi>French</hi> out of your Country, before we attempt any thing againſt a Princeſs of that Kingdom; we muſt pretend Plots and Machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they were contriving in the State, thereby to leſſen the eſteem the people have for her; and by degrees we may give ſo great an appearance of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to her death, that though your Majeſty ſhould be ſuſpected to have cauſed it, you could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacht with it. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> approved this laſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice very well, and committing the whole care of that affair to <hi>Nugnez,</hi> he gave himſelf wholly over to his Recreations with <hi>Padilla.</hi> The amorous <hi>Nugnez,</hi> trembling with horrour and fear for the diſcourſe he had had with the King, and judging with reaſon, that if he did not pretend to execute his Orders ſeverely, his Maſter would imploy ſome body elſe, who would obſerve them more ſtrictly, he began his hypocriſie by a general Baniſhment of all the <hi>French</hi> which attended the Queen: he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſecret practices on their part, inconſiſtent with his Majeſties indulgence, or the ſecurity of the Queen: he clapt Guards about the unfortunate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, who under colour of ſecuring her from <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro,</hi> had private Orders to have a care of her ſafety; and fearing perpetually leſt the King ſhould repent himſelf of his patience, and haſten her death ſome other way than by him, he commanded her Guards to let no perſon whatever come near her, unleſs a Ticket was produced under <hi>Nugnez</hi>'s hand. Theſe charitable cares, appearing contrary to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65131:110"/>motion, produced as much hatred in the heart of <hi>Blanche,</hi> as they ought to have done kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and obligation. What have I done to you? <hi>Nugnez,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him one day, to be made the object of an injuſtice I could never hear you have exerciſed upon any but me. All <hi>Caſtile</hi> ſpeaks of you as the moſt honourable Perſon it ever brought forth. Your compaſſion for the afflicted, and your reſpect for my Sex hath forced an eſteem for you, even from your Enemies; and will you deveſt your ſelf of theſe qualities, to become the Perſecutor of a poor Princeſs who never did you wrong, and had a great eſteem for you, before you declared your ſelf the greateſt Enemy ſhe had. I, Madam, replied <hi>Nugnez,</hi> am I the greateſt Enemy you have? And what other name, replied the Princeſs, can I give the man who keeps me in Priſon, who ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes my own Country-Servants out of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and carries his Tyranny ſo high, my very Women are not ſuffered to come near me, but by his ſpecial permiſſion. You will tell me perhaps the King hath commanded you to uſe me at that rate, but I cannot believe he can be guilty of ſo much injuſtice. It is you, Cruel you, who abuſe his Authority, inverting it againſt a Princeſs devoid of all ſuccour, and forcing her to Captivity, where ſhe expected a Crown. But once again, what is it I have done? if I have given you any offence againſt my knowledge (which yet I cannot imagine) the pitifulneſs of my Condition ought to ſatisfie your Vengeance; and if I have never offended you, how can you be ſo cruel to treat me as you do? Theſe words pierced poor <hi>Nugnez</hi> to the heart, he opened
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65131:110"/>his mouth a hundred times to have told <hi>Blanche</hi> the truth, but his fidelity to his Maſter not ſuffering him to betray his Confidence, he contented himſelf with ſome particular actions which might unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Princeſs, and rectifie the falſe Ideas ſhe had conceived, from the outward appearance of her affairs. There paſt not a day but he ſent her ſome little Preſent of Flowers, of Fruits, or of Eſſences: he provided her Voices and Muſick in ſome private part of her Appartment, to divert the tediouſneſs of her Impriſonment. He got a Collection of fine Pictures, and rare Birds to furniſh her Chambers, and ſpeaking the <hi>French</hi> Language very well, he made Verſes many times in that Tongue, which he preſented her for her diverſion. Theſe little Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities could not be kept ſo ſecret but theſe came to the Ears of <hi>Padilla.</hi> The Queen had a young Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin attending her at that time, called <hi>Jane de Caſtro,</hi> with whom <hi>Fernandez de Hyveſtroſa</hi> (one of <hi>Padil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>'s Uncles) was moſt deſperately in Love. By her means this ſubtle Miſtreſs had Intelligence of all that paſſed in <hi>Blanches</hi> Priſon, and judging (by what ſhe knew of the Kings animoſity) that he would be ill ſatisfied with <hi>Nugnez</hi>'s Generoſity, ſhe believed ſhe had now found a way of being reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the threats he formerly gave her. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured her Uncle to uſe all his Art for the diſcovery of the Intrigue betwixt the Princeſs and the Grand Maſter: for, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Fernandez,</hi> you may eaſily conceive <hi>Nugnez,</hi> who by the favour of the King is advanced to one of the chief Dignities of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, would not by the diſobeying of ſo good a Maſter expoſe himſelf, were he not tempted to that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65131:111"/>diſobedience by ſome conſiderable deſign: he muſt doubtleſs have Intelligences with the <hi>French</hi> to the prejudice of the State, and we are ſo much bound to his Majeſties Bounty, I think we are obliged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him any miſchief we are able. <hi>Fernandez</hi> acting upon his Nieces Memoires, preſt <hi>Jane</hi> by his Letters, and his Diſcourſe, to do as <hi>Padilla</hi> deſired; and when ſhe failed her expectation but a day, he would complain of his unkindneſs, in not returning her Anſwers; and at length having imployed all the influence he had upon the affections of this Maid, to debauch the fidelity ſhe ought to her Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, he managed his affairs ſo well, he cajol'd her out of theſe Verſes which <hi>Nugnez</hi> had made (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her knowledge) and <hi>Jane de Caſtro</hi> had found in her Pocket, as ſhe was putting her to Bed.</p>

                     <hi>Padilla</hi> had like to have killed her ſelf with joy at the ſight of theſe Verſes, <hi>Fernandez</hi> explained
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65131:111"/>them as he delivered them to her, and ſhe running with them immediately to the King, poſſeſt him highly againſt their innocent Love, and blackned his paſſion with ſuch formidable Colours, that had the King followed the firſt motions of his anger, he had ſent to have had <hi>Nugnez</hi> put immediately to death. But as he loved him very well, and could not eaſily forget the Services he had done him, he reſtrained himſelf in ſpight of his natural impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. The Queen was at that time in the Caſtle of <hi>Maqueda,</hi> where <hi>Nugnez</hi> to remove her out of the ſight of her Enemies, had cauſed her to be ſhut up. The Governour of the Caſtle had been put in by the Grand Maſter, and he had reaſon to believe he would be faithful to him, but there is no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip nor acknowledgment proof againſt the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ones natural Prince. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> ſent for the Governour to him, he ordered him to receive cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Troops privately into the Caſtle, to be ſure <hi>Nugnez</hi> knew nothing of them; and flattering his fidelity with as many fair promiſes, as he threatned his indiſcretion with puniſhments if he refuſed, he cauſed the Garriſon to be inſenſibly changed, and no Souldiers left of whom he was not ſecure. When he had uſed all this preliminary precaution, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered word to be brought him, when the Grand Maſter was with the Queen, and being deſirous to evict him by his own Eyes, he repaired privately to <hi>Maqueda,</hi> forbad the Governour upon penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his life, to give the Grand Maſter any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and being conducted by <hi>Jane de Caſtro</hi> into a Cloſet near the Princeſſes Chamber, where that young Virgin was uſed to liſten to their diſcourſes,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65131:112"/>the King heard <hi>Blanche</hi> tell him, Were there yet in theſe Flowers you ſend me any Serpent concealed, or were they impregnated with any poyſonous quality, that might put a ſpeedy end to my miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I ſhould ſay your heart began to mollifie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me: But I ſee well enough this Preſent is but a politick piece of Civility wherewith you ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the injuries you do me, and which you would not practiſe, without doubt, were it not to rob me of the feeble conſolation of complaining on you in all things. <hi>Nugnez</hi> was ſo much affected with a reproach he merited ſo little, that his patience was overcome: Why, Madam, ſaid he to the Princeſs with his voice quite changed, would you more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly receive poyſon from my hands, than theſe ſmall Preſents wherewith I endeavour to divert your ſad thoughts? Yes without doubt, replied the Queen, I ſhould look upon the poyſon as a token of your ſincerity, whereas I conſider all now but as ſo many tokens of your diſſimulation. Certainly, Madam, replied <hi>Nugnez</hi> tranſported with ſorrow, I have then complied very ill with your deſires; for I have expoſed my life and fortune, and do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them every day in not giving you that poyſon, you are ſo earneſt to have: and then his Love over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing his fidelity and reſolution, he began to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to the Queen the diſcourſe he had had with the King, the ſecret of his Conduct, which ſhe had not perceived; and finding himſelf inſenſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to ſpeak of his affection, be began to make a perfect declaration. But <hi>Don Pedro</hi> prevented him for that, giving him no leiſure to go through, he cryed out Arm, Arm, and entring into <hi>Blanches</hi>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:65131:112"/>Chamber with the Officers of his Guards, he cauſed <hi>Nugnez</hi> to be ſtab'd in his own preſence immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. The Queen would have run the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny, if his opinion that he could convict her of Amours betwixt <hi>Nugnez</hi> and her, had not made him reſerve her for more publick Juſtice. He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to be removed and kept cloſe in the Caſtle of <hi>Siquenca,</hi> and reſolving to cut her off with more formalities than her Gallant, he returned to <hi>Burgos,</hi> as well ſatisfied with his Journey, as if he had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſome conſiderable Victory. The miſchievous <hi>Padilla</hi> heapt her Congratulations upon him, for ſo noble an action: <hi>Fernandez</hi> flattering himſelf with the hopes of the Grand Maſters place in the favour of the King, could not ſatisfie his expectation with leſs than ſome eminent Dignity. But ſee the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of humane deſigns: <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who had never lookt upon <hi>Jane de Caſtro</hi> but with eyes prepoſſeſt by <hi>Padilla,</hi> being at that time diſpoſed to a change, he became enamour'd of her when he ſaw her in the Caſtle of <hi>Maqueda.</hi> His heart was tender, <hi>Jane</hi> was amiable, and what had paſt lately in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> having given <hi>Don Pedro</hi> a reliſh of injuſtice and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, he regarded not his Marriage with <hi>Blanche</hi> as an obſtruction to his new deſires: he gained two of the Biſhops of his Kingdom to declare that his Marriage with the Queen not being conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, it was lawful for him to take another as he pleaſed, and upon their bare Authority he married <hi>Jane de Caſtro</hi> publickly without any ſcruple. It is eaſie to judge <hi>Padilla</hi> and <hi>Fernandez de Hyveſtroſa</hi> were nettled to the quick by this ſudden Wedding. This ambitious Miſtreſs, who could not endure ſo
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:65131:113"/>much as the ſhadow of a Queen upon the Throne of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> found it now in the full poſſeſſion of an abſolute Queen beloved by the King; and <hi>Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez,</hi> who flattered by the promiſes of his Niece, had been the ſecret Inſtrument of <hi>Nugnez</hi>'s death, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no other fruit of his inhumanity, than a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from the Court, and the loſs of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, which he loved above the World. Had that Miſtreſs of his been as ſenſible of <hi>Fernandez</hi> deſpair as he had reaſon to hope, ſhe would have refuſed the Crown which was offered her; but that Age was like ours, they ſtood not much upon Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the Glory of being a Queen outweighed the ſhame of infidelity, and let Lovers ſay what they will, a Crown is better than a Garland. In the mean time the unfortunate <hi>Blanche</hi> was alone in the Caſtle condoling the loſs of her Grand Maſter, ſhe underſtood then (but it was too late) the difference betwixt her paſt and her preſent Captivity: and the Image of <hi>Nugnez</hi> ſtab'd in her preſence for her ſake, cauſed ſuch bitter remorſes in her mind, ſhe had much ado to keep her ſelf alive. But we will leave her to mode her Complaints as ſhe pleaſe, and prepare her ſelf for that Poyſon which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her ſome few days after, to give ſome relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Pen. The principal parts of theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals having been mentioned before, it ought to be allowed us to repoſe after ſo rapid a Carieer: The reſt of the Reign of <hi>Pedro de Caſtile</hi> is ſo repleat with Murders and Cruelties of all ſorts, that I could not deſcribe them without falling into a Tragical reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which I have always carefully avoided.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>JOhn Paleologus,</hi> Emperour of <hi>Greece,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Calos</hi> (which in that Language ſignifies Fair) lived about two hundred years ſince. His Son <hi>Emanuel</hi> being gone with Supplies to the Emperor of <hi>Trebiſonde</hi> his Ally, whom <hi>Mammomas</hi> Prince of <hi>Peloponeſius</hi> had invaded with a formidable Army, fell in Love with the ſaid Emperours Daughter, and ſignified his Love to <hi>Calo-John.</hi> The Father lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Son even to Idolatry, was ſo far from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65131:114"/>his deſign, that he ſent Embaſſadours to the Emperour of <hi>Trebiſonde</hi> to demand his Daughter for him, and it was granted; <hi>Emanuel</hi> was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to her, and took her away with him to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> where the Ceremony was to be conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. This Princeſs was beloved by the ſame <hi>Mammomas</hi> who made War upon her Father; he had likewiſe demanded her in Marriage, but was refuſed, and upon that refuſal he betook himſelf to his Arms. When he underſtood that to that reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they had added the preference of another, he addreſt himſelf to <hi>Amurah</hi> II. whoſe Ally he was, and who he knew watcht for an occaſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War upon the <hi>Greeks:</hi> he conjured him for his aſſiſtance, and <hi>Amurahs</hi> Policy accommodating with the requeſt, he had a favourable Anſwer. He diſpatcht an Envoye to <hi>Calo-John</hi> to let him know, that <hi>Mammomas</hi> had demanded the Infanta, which was contracted to his Son; that <hi>Mammomas</hi> being an Ally of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, he was obliged to aſſiſt him, and to look upon all ſuch as Enemies that oppoſed his Deſigns. This Declaration was as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt as unſeaſonable. <hi>Emanuel</hi> was to be preferred before his Rival, in reſpect of his Dignity; beſides the Infanta was within two days Journey of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople:</hi> But the Power of the <hi>Turk</hi> being ſo terrible, that the Emperour of <hi>Greece</hi> judged it his beſt way to treat him with all imaginable Civility. He ſuſpended the Marriage, ſent an Embaſſadour to <hi>Amurahs</hi> to repreſent the pretences of his Son; and the Infanta being too far advanced to go back, was conducted to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where ſhe remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as <hi>in depoſito,</hi> till the Negotiation was ended.

But his deſires and his murmures were in vain, there was no remedy but patience. The <hi>Infanta</hi> (who loved him as ardently as he loved her) omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhe could think of to comfort him in ſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious an attendance. She diſcovered to him in her Eye the extreme tenderneſs of her Heart: She ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died his looks, and indulged his deſires as ſoon as ſhe diſcryed them.</p>

               <p>Juſt ſo it was with the young Prince <hi>Emanuel,</hi> he began to be ſo accuſtomed to his felicity, and ſo familiarly with her, ſhe became indifferent to him; there muſt be playing at Cards, a great deal of Company, or ſome other diverſion, or he could not be kept a day together in his Miſtreſſes Chamber; when in the publick Walks the Princeſs according to her uſual manner applied her ſelf particularly to him, Love had leſs ſhare in his diſcourſe than the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65131:115"/>fall of a Caſcade, or the form of a Statue. The <hi>Infanta</hi> was not long before ſhe diſcovered this Change; but thoſe who love exceedingly, are apt to flatter themſelves with the thought that they are beloved again, though never ſo little. The Prince having been one day two hours together with the Princeſs in the Gardens belonging to the Palace, without ſpeaking one word to her, but of Flowers and Plants: How long, Sir, ſaid ſhe ſmiling, is it ſince you have been a Floriſt? have you no other diſcourſe to entertain me with but of them? How would you have me entertain you, Madam, replied the Prince, all my ſtock of Complements and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations are exhauſt? The Princeſs bluſht at his anſwer; but imagining the Prince ſaid it only to ſound her, ſhe replied, I ſhall not run, Sir, into all the Traps that are laid for me, and you may feign your ſelf indifferent long enough, before I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is poſſible. I am not indifferent indeed, replied the Prince, I love you as much as I am capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of loving; but all things, Madam, have their ſeaſon: the fears and the paſſions of other Lovers belong not to us; you ought to believe I love you, and I am very well ſatisfied you have no hatred for me; you give me no occaſion to be jealous, and I do few things you are not witneſs to your ſelf. What is it then I ſhould diſcourſe of? what have I elſe to ſay to you? or what have you elſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? Why, Sir, ſaid the <hi>Infanta,</hi> interrupting him, is it poſſible you ſhould ſpeak from your heart? do not you find in your affections an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible bank of obliging things to ſay to me? and can you who have triumpht and boaſted of your
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65131:115"/>great skill in loving well, be ignorant that whatever is ſpoken by Lovers to their Miſtreſſes, is always accompanied with ſome new grace or other to recommend it? You ſpeak, Madam, like a Lady in a Romance, replied the Prince; and I ſhould take great pleaſure to read your Highneſſes Maxims in a Book; but to practiſe them, I find very incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious. Believe me, Madam, we ought to love like rational Creatures, take that part of it that is agreeable, and leave the troubleſom behind; Fears, and Jealouſies, and Emotions have had their time: 'tis but reaſonable now that Confidence and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity ſhould have theirs. Ha! Sir, ſaid the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, with tears in her Eyes, then I ſee you love me no longer, that confidence and that tranquillity you ſpeak of are incompatible with true Love. Alas! Sir, continued ſhe, if you be already come to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference and luke-warmneſs of a Husband, before I am your Wife, what am I to hope for when our Marriage is conſummate? Whether the Prince was not yet hardned enough to ſee the tears of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi> running down her Cheeks without compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or whether the Title of unconſtant gave him ſome kind of regret, but he did what he could to pacifie his Miſtreſs: He conjured her not to frame Chymaeras to her ſelf ſo repugnant to her repoſe; he proteſted he loved her with as much ardour as ſhe could deſire. But he being perfectly cured, and Love having the only power to delineate it ſelf, there was not one action he did, but gave his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations the lye. He became gallant and frolick among the Ladies; he commended them for Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before his Miſtreſs, and as the higheſt inſtance of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65131:116"/>his tranquillity, he neither obſerved the troubles which he cauſed, nor apprehended what he did that could cauſe them. The Emperours eye was not ſo dull, it was not for nothing Nature had made him worthy of the ſirname of Fair, he had been always as ſubject to be in Love with other people as other people were to be in Love with him, and though Hiſtory repreſents him at that time ſixty years old, yet

                     <l>Love's an ill habit ſeiſing on the ſenſe,</l>
                     <l>And th' more we'ave lov'd, making us love the more.</l>
                  </q>

               <p>The Emperour ſent for his Son, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to him, and rebuked him for his cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> he demanded, if he had diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any new fault in her, which he perceived not before; if ſhe had betrayed him in any thing alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; or if he apprehended ſhe would do for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. No, Sir, replied the Prince, the <hi>Infanta</hi> is as wiſe as ſhe is fair, and I have no cauſe at all to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of her proceedings. Why then, ſaid the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, do not you love her as well as you have dose. It is; Sir, replied the Prince, becauſe there is nothing eternal here below; do you know, Sir, any thing upon the Earth but hath an end? or can any man inſtance in an Amour that laſted as long as the Lover lived? I confeſs, ſays the Emperour, there is nothing more common than variation in Love; but thoſe variations have their Cauſes, either in the poſſeſſion of the thing they love, or in the attraction
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65131:116"/>of ſome new Miſtreſs: Can you pretend either of the two? what new Lady is it has captivated you, or has the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s good Nature permitted your Love to advance ſo far, that it is at its achme, and muſt of neceſſity decline? No, Sir, replied the Prince, I have neither of thoſe reaſons to pretend; the <hi>Infanta</hi> is virtuous, and I muſt needs ſay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be better beloved: but, Sir, no man is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his own ſentiments, and it is as vain as unjuſt for a Miſtreſs to call her Servant to an account for inconſtancy; as we love many times in ſpight of our teeths, ſo we cool and abate in our Loves, and ſometimes give quite over without any reaſonable cauſe. However, replied the Emperour, for a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſtop in the middle of its Cariere, as yours has done, is a thing I have not heard of before: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be more, or whether it be leſs, you love the <hi>Infanta</hi> ſtill, though but indifferently, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference is but the effect of ſome extraordinary kindneſs ſhe has ſhewn you which has ſatiated your deſires. I beſeech you, Sir, replied <hi>Emanuel,</hi> do not trouble your ſelf with thoſe apprehenſions, I am nothing at all of what you think, and nothing elſe but what I tell you; I have not thoſe violent paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and inquietudes I formerly have had, but it is only becauſe I fancy them unſeaſonable; I look upon my ſelf now as the Maſter of the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhe has no Intrigue, nor Jealouſie, I tell her what I pleaſe, I ſee her when I pleaſe, and I am aſſured I ſhall poſſeſs her: whence then ſhould I derive my apprehenſions? what reaſon have I to lye ſobbing, and counting the minutes, when I can ſpeak to her when ever I deſire? why ſhould I be
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65131:117"/>jealous, when I am ſatisfied I have no Rival? Take away theſe emotions from Love, the caſe will be mine, and nothing remaining but what is in me. The Emperour was tranſported to hear his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; yet it was not without regret for fear he ſhould return: This coolneſs of yours, Son, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Emperour very ſlyly, can never laſt long; thoſe who are accuſtomed to the pleaſures of Love, cannot ſo eaſily renounce them, it is hard for one to clear himſelf of the ſecret tranſports, the amorous diſquiets, the fears, the impatiences; and in a word, the whole train of indiſpenſable conſequences which attend upon that paſſion; they do ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly poſſeſs the Soul they inhabit, the very want of them is troubleſom, when the paſſion ceaſes. On the contrary, Sir, replied <hi>Emanuel</hi> interrupting him, I muſt tell you (if it be lawful for me to be of an opinion oppoſite to yours) that the Effects of Love which create that violence in the beginning, haſtens, may precipitate the Cure; when a Lover is but once arrived at this, that he can look ſoberly upon his Love, I cannot imagine how it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my reaſon could diſpenſe with the extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies I have committed: I am aſhamed of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Errours, and I do now find them a great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboration to my Philoſophy. Not, Sir, but I am reſolved to marry the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Trebiſonde,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have promiſed it, and I dare promiſe you to live with her as you will deſire: But I beſeech you, Sir, oblige me no farther than the Civilties and Formalities of a Husband; the ardencies and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences of Love are not to be expected from me. This was a point the Emperour had no deſign to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65131:117"/>preſs upon his Son, and therefore he left him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expoſtulating farther, and forming his hopes upon what he had told him, he clapt ſuch perſons about the <hi>Infanta,</hi> as were buzzing perpetually into her Ears, That the Emperour was not troubled with any of the incommodities of old age; That in Activity and Courtſhip he out-did all the reſt of his Court, and, That doubtleſs he was ſo vigorous and ſtrong, his Son was like to languiſh a long time, before he could expect to arrive at the Empire. To theſe diſcourſes (which were delivered as it were by accident) they added more poſitive. The Prince gave no tokens of his indifference to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> but the Emperour made her ſenſible of them; if he left her, as it happened often, to ſpeak to another Lady; What an Age do we live in, Madam, would he cry: in my time it was eſteemed a Crime to loſe the leaſt moment a man could dedicate to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, we thought we had never time enough to ſpeak our affections: and when <hi>Emanuel</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted his Miſtreſs in any thing, Do you believe, would he ſay, that when I was a young man, it would have been permitted a Servant ſhould have been of one mind, and his Miſtreſs on another? no certainly, their Love or their Breeding was better than ſo, and when I was at the age of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> if I ſhould have been guilty of doing that once, which he practiſes continually, I ſhould have been thought the moſt giddy and inconſtant Lover in the World. How! ſaid he another time, does <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> converſe with other Ladies in your preſence, and I not find his Eye upon you all the time of his diſcourſe? Believe me, Madam, ſaid he, you muſt
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65131:118"/>diſcipline this young man, and teach him his duty a little better, his felicity beſots him, and you will loſe him in time, if you give him not now and then a quarter of an hours experience of your rigour. The Princeſs made uſe ſeveral times of <hi>Calo-Johns</hi> advice, but without any ſucceſs: The Prince was never the more fond for thoſe kind of Artifices; he found the <hi>Infanta</hi> always ſweet enough upon him to ſerve his turn, and when ſhe was angry, it concerned him leſs than when ſhe was kind. As he was in this diſpoſition, the Emperour had advice that <hi>Mammomas</hi> having inſinuated with certain Lords of a Province belonging to the Empire, not far from <hi>Peloponeſſus,</hi> had debauched them to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt: He ſent the Prince <hi>Emanuel</hi> with an Army to reduce them, and in his abſence declaring to the Princeſs what he underſtood of the indifferencies of his Son, he knew ſo well how to repreſent to her the reſentment a diſcreet Woman ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, when ſhe finds her ſelf deſpiſed by her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and deſcribed all the Diſcourſes he had held with his Son, ſo exactly, that he found he had ſtir'd up her indignation before he was aware. The Letters ſhe received from <hi>Emanuel,</hi> did not a little confirm the ſuggeſtions of his Father: They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained nothing but indifferent relations; and if indiſpenſable Civility cauſed him to mention any thing of Love, it was ſo flat and inſipid, it was eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be diſcerned he did it by conſtraint. One would have thought he had apprehended the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of ſome jealous perſon; he expreſt his deſires ſo indifferently, one would have thought his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had retained the beſt half of his mind. He
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65131:118"/>forgot himſelf one day ſo far in his tranquillities, that he gave a moſt excellent Character of <hi>Mammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> not conſidering he was his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, and ſuch a Rival as had been able to keep him from the poſſeſſion of his Miſtreſs. This is too much, cryed the Princeſs, when ſhe read the Letter, the Prince at length tires out my patience, and I ſhall be reproacht all <hi>Greece</hi> over as an inſenſible perſon, if knowing how <hi>Emanuel</hi> uſes me, I let him not underſtand again that I am not ignorant of ways to revenge my ſelf. And this reſolution was no ſooner taken than executed. The <hi>Infanta</hi> told the Emperour, that ſhe was at laſt grown weary of the Princes neglects; that ſhe would dye a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand deaths before ſhe would marry him; and that ſhe was come to acquaint him, ſhe would ſacrifice her ſelf, before ſhe would ſubmit to the Conditions of the Treaty. This was it the Emperour deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: he commended her reſentment, proteſted the deportment of his Son was no leſs ungrateful to his Ears than to hers, and wiſhing with all his heart he had been of an age to make her reparation himſelf, he ſollicited her to vengeance ſo hard, that at length ſhe liſtned to his Propoſals. She writ a Letter to the Emperor of <hi>Trebiſonde</hi> by agreement with <hi>Calo-John;</hi> the Pacquet was delivered into the hands of an Agent, very faithful to the Emperour, and of a Wit as conſiderable as his fidelity. It would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to delineate <hi>Calo-John</hi> exactly as he was at that time, to make the Reader conceive all that Love is able to make a man of his age do. He brake the brains of all the Officers of his Chamber to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him new dreſſes; he truſted none but his own
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65131:119"/>Eyes in the choice of the Colors he wore, and paſſing whole hours in converſation with his Glaſs; What thinkeſt thou, <hi>Calo-John,</hi> ſaid he to himſelf, how doſt thou like this Figure in the Glaſs? this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, is it not fine? theſe Eyes, are they not ſoft and well made? they are not ſo ſparkling indeed, as when I was young; but in Love the ſoftneſs and ſweetneſs of the Eye doth more execution many times, than the quickneſs and vivacity: What ſay you to this Shape, this Leg, this whole Contexture? ſaid he, marching two or three ſteps with great magnificence. Ha! <hi>Calo-John,</hi> 'tis not for nothing the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Trebiſonde</hi> prefers you to your Son; thou art a thouſand times handſomer and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable than he, and this Election of the Princeſs is an effect of the ſolidity of her Judgment, rather than a token of her anger. Whilſt the Emperour was pleaſing himſelf in this manner in his own Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy and Merits, his Son had reduced the Rebels to the Terms his Father deſired, and there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to detain him longer upon the Frontiers, he returned to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with the ſame ſerenity he departed. He found the Princeſs much colder to him than formerly, and the Emperour more ſpruce, but he did not concern himſelf for either; he was glad to find the Princeſs no more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and did not dive into the fineneſs of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He recounted his Exploits to his Miſtreſs in the ſame ſtyle he had writ them; and ſhe told him (Ironically) ſhe was much obliged to him for the deſcription he had given her of <hi>Mammomas;</hi> that ſhe had a great honour for his qualities, and that ſhe did not believe when ſhe vanquiſht his heart, ſhe
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65131:119"/>had had ſo illuſtrious a Captive. Our Lover being hardned, took all in the literal ſenſe, and juſtified every tittle he had mentioned in his Letter: A good way to moderate the tranſport of a Miſtreſs at the return of her Servant. The <hi>Infanta</hi>'s indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation increaſed every hour, and the affairs of the Emperour went better and better. He failed not to ply her with thanks, both by Letters, and word of Mouth; and ſuppoſing his acknowlegments would be more eloquent in Verſe than in Proſe, he rub'd up his old fancy for a Paper of good Verſes. Our Memoires do not repreſent them in a ſtyle <hi>à la mode,</hi> as to their Art or Invention, but his ardour and ſincerity is conſpicuous in them to this day. One time when he had out-done himſelf in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the felicity he promiſed to himſelf, the Princeſs by ill Fortune dropt the Paper before the Prince, who taking it up, had a Curioſity to read it contrary to his Cuſtom, but the <hi>Infanta</hi> diſcerning what it was; Do not read it, Sir, ſaid ſhe to him, they are Love-Verſes. <hi>Emanuel</hi> ſmiled, and not believing what ſhe ſaid, I am ſufficiently your Friend, Madam, replied he, to be intruſted with your Secrets; and having ſaid thoſe words, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Paper. The Princeſs clapt her hand upon it, and told him, you do not believe me, and yet I'le aſſure you I ſay true: Yes, ſaid the Prince, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting her a little angerly, I do believe you, it may be ſome body makes Love to you: but I will ſee, by your favour, after what manner he doth it; who-ever it be, he is ſomething audacious, and has choſen an ill field to engage in; and then forcing the Paper from the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and knowing it to be
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65131:120"/>the Emperours hand; How, ſays he ſmiling, is it the Emperour in truth? let's ſee if he can make Love as well now as of old.</p>

                  <hi>Emanuel</hi> thought the Emperour had but jeſted before, and looking upon it as a deſign of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi>'s to make him jealous, he laught in his ſleeve at the innocence of the project. But when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Emperour was in earneſt, he began as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to be diſpleaſed; Sure, ſaid he, the Affairs of the Empire are but very few, when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour can have leiſure to imploy himſelf about ſuch trifles. You did not formerly, replied the <hi>Infanta,</hi> call the marks you gave me of your paſſion, Trifles? It is not the ſame caſe, replied the Prince, I was in Love, <hi>Calo-John</hi> is not. He believes he is, more than you, and truly I am of opinion it will laſt
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65131:120"/>longer. <hi>Emanuel</hi> thought the Princeſs had jeſted, and yet that kind of jeſting he did not like; he went to wait upon the Emperour, and ſhewing him the Verſes he had taken from the Princeſs; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, Sir, ſaid he, will you divert your ſelf ſome other way, than by writing theſe Love-things to the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Trebiſonde;</hi> I know it is but in ſport, and that you have no intention to be ſerious; but they may accuſtom her to them, and ſhe be brought by degrees to receive them from ſome body elſe: and you know, Sir, a man cannot be too cautious in things of that nature. That care, replied the Emperour (without any emotion) belongs to me, I ſhall have ſuch an eye over her Conduct, you ſhall not need to trouble your ſelf at all. I confeſs, Sir, replied the Prince, as you are my Father, the deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her who is deſigned to be my Wife, may concern you; yet that concern is but ſmall, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what a Husband ought to have. I know all thoſe differences <hi>Emanuel,</hi> ſaid the Emperour, and therefore I tell you, you need not trouble your ſelf. How unlikely ſoever it was, the Emperour ſhould be enamour'd of the Princeſs who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to his Son, the Prince knowing his Fathers temper, conceived violent ſuſpicions thereof. He returned immediately to the Princeſs, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his old flames to riſe out of this ſpark of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie; Could it be poſſible, Madam, ſaid he to the Princeſs, that the Verſes you let fall, and I took up, ſhould have been written in earneſt? Why, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, and would you receive Propoſitions of Love from my Father? Yes, Sir, replied the <hi>Infanta,</hi> I would do any thing might reſcue me from your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65131:121"/>you have made it, Sir, too manifeſt, and my patience would not have been any longer the effect of my fidelity, but of a baſeneſs without excuſe or example. <hi>Emanuel</hi> was ſtartled at theſe words, as if they had been Thunder. I did not believe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid he to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> you could have taken the marks of right reaſon for diſdain, they being always the infallible conſequences of a declared Love. I lookt upon you always as a diſcreet Lady, and thought it would be more acceptable to you, if I behaved my ſelf as a Husband before you were my Wife, than to have changed my deportment after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: But, Madam, ſince I ſee you are not of my mind, I muſt hereafter ſerve you according to your own; return to me, and I ſhall return to every thing that will pleaſe you, you have no more to do, but to make the Laws, and it ſhall be my care to obey them all, Madam, but renouncing my intereſt in you. Anger is a cheat, and ſeldom as good as its promiſe: The <hi>Infanta</hi> had reaſon indeed, and was really angry with <hi>Emanuel;</hi> he had neglected her, he had given her a thouſand indications of the declenſion of his Love, and he had added diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to his actions; Nevertheleſs when ſhe ſaw him ſubmit, and repent, and remembred that he was the ſame Prince ſhe had loved ſo entirely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, her Choler was diſſipated, ſhe forgot what ſhe ought to the hopes of the Emperour, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations ſhe had made to him, and ſhe began to renew her Commerce with the Prince upon new Conditions, when <hi>Calo-John</hi> entred into her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. He had Advertiſement that <hi>Emanuel</hi> was gone to make the <hi>Infanta</hi> a Viſit, and was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65131:121"/>that Love was capable of Reconciliation. Did not I tell you this morning, ſaid he very haſtily to his Son, you need not trouble your ſelf any farther for any thing relating to the Princeſs, for I my ſelf would take that care upon me; How comes it then, <hi>Emanuel,</hi> your eye is ſtill ſo vigilant over her? I thought, Sir, replied the Prince, I had been obliged to have a care over her, both by your order, and the Emperours her Fathers. Thoſe Orders were given long ſince, replied <hi>Calo-John,</hi> but now they are out of doors. You told me your ſelf you had no paſſion for the Princeſs, and that you would not marry her for any other reaſon but becauſe you had promiſed. I am ſo good a Father, I will not hold you to that promiſe; I underſtand Marriage very well, and I know it is as much as one can do to live contentedly with a Woman that he loves, how then can you expect to live well with one you do not love at all? The Prince would have replied, and proteſted he loved the <hi>Infanta</hi> as well as he ever did in his life: but the Emperour who had no mind to thoſe kind of proteſtations, interrupted him, and commanded him to be gone. The Command ſeemed ſomething harſh, the Prince endeavoured to diſobey, and replies, growing hot: the Prince let fall ſome words, which were not perhaps exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the Rules of Reſpect, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Emperour cauſed him to be ſeized: And this point of rigour recalled all the kindneſs the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi> had ever had for him; ſhe prayed, ſhe preſt, and her importunity increaſed rather than extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated his Crime: Love took up his reſt now in the heart of the Princeſs; ſhe repented ſhe ever had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65131:122"/>and would not endure to hear the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours pretenſions ſo much as mentioned any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. In the mean time whilſt things were in this poſture, an Envoyé arrived from the Emperour of <hi>Trebiſond:</hi> The ſaid Emperour, Father to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> had been much troubled to conſent to the Exchange; he was a ſevere Prince, and his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions immoveable: Nevertheleſs the dexterity of the Agent was ſuch, he was over-power'd, and conſented that the Princeſs ſhould marry <hi>Calo-John,</hi> but it was with ſuch expreſs Order to change no more, that the Princeſs durſt never diſobey: And to compleat the ruine of <hi>Emanuels</hi> Affairs, <hi>Mammomas</hi> being by <hi>Amurath</hi> ſuſpected of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with a Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> who refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to admit him for his Soveraign; the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour deſerted him, and left him to <hi>Calo-John</hi> to be infeſted as he pleaſed. In ſhort, he married the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Trebiſond,</hi> notwithſtanding all the oppoſition ſhe made; her Father commanded it, the Emperour was abſolute, and Princeſſes of her Rank are but Sacrifices to Policy and Convenience, inſomuch that Nature would have very much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the greateſt part of them, had ſhe brought them into the World without hearts: It is not to be expreſt the rage <hi>Emanuel</hi> conceived at the News of this Wedding, but the effects which inſued may in ſome meaſure diſcover it. He eſcaped out of Priſon, implored the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Amurath,</hi> and conducting him as it were by the hand to the Throne Imperial of <hi>Greece,</hi> he gave the fatal blow to that flouriſhing Empire; for which Phrenſie he was ſufficiently puniſht himſelf by the ingratitude
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65131:122"/>of the <hi>Turk,</hi> who not keeping one tittle of all the promiſes he had made him, cauſed him to end his days miſerably without his eyes, and without any other Dignity than a private place among his Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſaries: and the great <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire eſcaped no better than he. But the Divine Juſtice which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged <hi>Calo-John</hi> for the evils his Sons fury had brought upon him, hath not as yet revenged the infidelity of their common Tyrant.</p>
               <p>The Order we have obſerved hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in our Chronology,<note place="margin">Amedy <hi>Duke of</hi> Savoye.</note> conducts us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly to the Occurrences in the Life of <hi>Amade</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> whom ſome people call <hi>Amé,</hi> a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo well known in Hiſtory by the name of <hi>Felix</hi> the Anti-pope. He was of an amorous Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, and (it frequently happening that the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers are the Apes of the Actions of their Princes) thoſe which were performed by this Duke, were immediately followed by the whole Court: So that he being Voluptuous, his Court became a very School of Luxury and Debauchedneſs. All Offices and Honours were confer'd according to their amorous Exploits, and Love becoming the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of Merit, ſuch as were the moſt ſuſceptible of that paſſion, were moſt gracious with their Prince: For theſe reaſons and ſuch other, the Marqueſs of <hi>Savona</hi> was in particular Favour: He was not the Dukes Subject, but had ſo linked himſelf to him by his good Services, that he was become the Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of his Secrets, the Diſpencer of his Graces, and the Companion of his Debauches. One night as they were marcht together to viſit a Lady (ſome
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65131:123"/>few Leagues from <hi>Turin</hi>) for whom the Duke had a great kindneſs, and the Marqueſs managed the affair, they loſt themſelves in a Wood through which they were to paſs, and at laſt found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at a Houſe belonging to the Count <hi>de la Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riene:</hi> This Count had ſeveral years before baniſht himſelf voluntarily from the Court; he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a wound at the beginning of this Dukes Reign, which had almoſt taken away his Eyes, and having not thought himſelf rewarded for ſo important a loſs, he retired into the Country where he lived very privately. Some indiſpenſable Affairs having cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to a Houſe he had near <hi>Turin,</hi> he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to make a Viſit there, and was returned ſome few hours before the Duke loſt himſelf, and was brought thither: When <hi>Amede</hi> and his Favourite diſcovered that Houſe, they reſolved to repoſe themſelves, it was late, they had wandred a long time, and were ſomething wet with the Rain. The Marqueſs clapt Spurs to inquire whoſe Houſe, but when he was told it belonged to the Marqueſs <hi>de la Moriene,</hi> and that he was at home, he returned to the Duke to let him know they muſt march on, for that Count was an old Stoick, who would not fail to wipe them for being abroad, and in that Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page ſo late: We muſt conceal my Name then, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Amede,</hi> his ſight is not very good, he hath not been this long time at the Court, I have but few of my Guards about me, and they no Liveries or other Marks to diſcover them: Ha! Sir, replied the Marqueſs, Soveraigns are not to be concealed in their own Countries, a Picture, the meeting of a Servant that hath ſeen you in the ſtreets of <hi>Turin,</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:65131:123"/>the reſpect your own Equipage will ſhew you and in ſhort, a thouſand little things will diſcover to the Count, that you are the Duke of <hi>Savoye.</hi> Well, if he does, replied the Duke, that inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is leſs than to be drowned in the Rain, or break ones Neck off of ones Horſe. If the Count knows me, I will be even with him for ſome Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures I have heard of his; and if he doth not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a while at his Houſe, we ſhall be the better afterwards to proceed in our Journey; upon which the Duke ſpur'd on to the Counts houſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Retinue to take no notice who he was, he pretended to be one of the little Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> with which that Country ſwarms. It was not out of Honour or Concernment for the Duke, that the Marqueſs of <hi>Savona</hi> had no mind to repoſe at this place. The Count <hi>de la Moriene</hi> had a handſom Lady to his Wife, which was related to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, and with whom, the Hiſtory ſays, there was more than one kind of proximity. By reaſon of the moroſity of her Husband, ſhe never came to Court; but ſhe pretended buſineſs now and then at her houſe by <hi>Turin,</hi> where the Marqueſs would meet her. He doubted not but ſhe was then with her Husband, and knowing how ready the Duke was to take fire, he had a ſtrong apprehenſion he would be ſmitten with the Counteſs. Word was carried in to the Count <hi>de Moriene,</hi> that a Perſon of Quality deſired to ſee him, and that the Marqueſs of <hi>Savona,</hi> his Wifes Couſin, was of the Company, he came forth himſelf to receive them. He preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with what the time of night, and the ſmall time the Count had been there, could afford, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65131:124"/>whilſt they were at their Repaſt, <hi>Amedy</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he was making a Viſit to the Duke of <hi>Savoye,</hi> and had miſtaken his way <hi>Turin,</hi> the Count interrupted him, and told him, You had beſt, Sir, be ſure the Duke be there, before you go thither your ſelf, for he is ſeldom to be found where he ought to be lookt for; his pleaſures invite him to ſo many places, where one would never expect to find him, that without good ſtore of Scouts 'tis no eaſie matter to diſcover him. You know the Duke, replied the Marqueſs ſomething haſtily, but by other peoples report, you have ſeen him your ſelf ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for theſe feveral years, you can ſay nothing upon your own knowledge; were you better acquainted with him, you would not ſpeak at that rate. It is not neceſſary to ſee ones Soveraign, to know him, replied the Count, we judge of them by their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of which they have ſo many Witneſſes, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of them is not to be kept out of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote or obſcure part of their Dominions; and then thundring out a long Declamation againſt <hi>Amedy</hi> and his Reign, there was not a Libel, or a mutinous Expreſſion that eſcaped him. The Marqueſs could give him no ſign to reſtrain him; for the Count had an infirmity in his Eyes, and could not perceive him. The Regale was ſomething rare for the Duke; and as is to be ſuppoſed wanted no ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. People which are ſatiated with pleaſures, are commonly very eloquent in decrying them. The Counteſs entred as the Philoſopher was in the midſt of his Ethicks, and the Duke not being ſo much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to her, as to her purblind Husband, there was not an Apology of which ſhe made not uſe to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65131:124"/>excuſe the Errour of the Count. The old Stoick could not without great difficulty be brought to ſo much as to counterfeit Repentance, he declared that the Equipage of the Duke of <hi>Savoye</hi> gave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to all he could ſay; that it would be well for that Prince if he had ſuch Adventures oftner, and applauded himſelf in what he had done, as it had been the beſt action of his life; all the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of the Marqueſs, and all the intreaties of the Counteſs were little enough to perſwade him to ask pardon: and he did well to be ſo difficult, for all they importuned him to, was to no purpoſe; the Duke found the Counteſs too handſom to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don her Husband. When he was departed, and found himſelf at liberty to deliver his thoughts: Ha! <hi>Savona,</hi> cryed he, how charming is this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs? how could you forbear boaſting of her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty till now? and knowing my inclination to hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Ladies, why have you not ſollicited me to ſend for her to Court? I did not perceive, Sir, there was any want of her there, replied the Marqueſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing gravely: there were ſo many Ladies already handſomer than ſhe, I thought ſhe would not be deſired. Do you ſay, ſaid the Duke to him a little ſhort, there is any thing in <hi>Savoye</hi> handſomer than the Counteſs? Yes, Sir, without doubt, replied the Marqueſs, the Lady you are going to viſit, is in my Eye much handſomer. You know not what is Beauty then, replied the Duke, or you do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what you ſay: there is nothing upon the Earth ſo amiable as the Counteſs, I muſt have her to <hi>Turin,</hi> the temerity of her Husband hath given me occaſion to cauſe him to be arreſted; and his
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65131:125"/>Wife will not fail to ſollicite for his liberty: let us haſte back again to put this Artifice in execution, I have no further buſineſs with the Lady I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee, for the Counteſs <hi>de la Moriene</hi> hath at preſent the whole poſſeſſion of my Soul. Theſe words were as ſo many mortal wounds in the heart of the amorous Marqueſs. He conjured the Duke to remember that the Counteſs was his Kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and not to make ſuch a breach on the favours wherewith he had honoured him; he alledged that it would be believed at Court, his Credit and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon his Highneſs was loſt, when it ſhould be ſeen that the Husband of ſo near a Relation of his, was treated with that rigour. What he hath ſaid of me, replied the Duke, ought to render him odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all that love me: and you ought to have been the firſt to have demanded his puniſhment. Beſides, <hi>Savona,</hi> the deſign I have imparted to you ought not to alarm your punctilioes of Conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, you may be ſure I will do your Kinſwoman no harm, I will reſcue her out of a Deſert, where ſhe cannot but live with much trouble &amp; reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; I will give her the choice of all things a witty Woman ought to Ambition; and if ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands how to manage her own Fortune, what you look upon as the unhappineſs of the Count, will prove at laſt the Eſtabliſhment of his Family. As he reſolved, ſo he did: he ſent to the Count <hi>de la Moriene</hi>'s Houſe to apprehend him; he cauſed him to be committed to a Tower, where his greateſt Priſoners were uſually diſpoſed; and that he might he more commodiouſly enjoy the ſollicitations of the Counteſs, he retired for ſome time to the Caſtle
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65131:125"/>of <hi>Thonon,</hi> ſituate upon the Lake of <hi>Leman,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Country-houſe in which he principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted. The Impriſonment of the Count <hi>de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riene</hi> made a terrible noiſe in the Court of <hi>Savoy.</hi> Such as were rigid and moroſe condemned it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and called it no leſs than violence and injuſtice. Some whoſe penetration was better than their Neighbours, ſuſpected the true cauſe, whilſt others who were guided by their Intereſt, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their reſpect, alledging he did well to puniſh the inſolence of that man, That in the actions of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns all things were to be regarded as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Providence; that that which was ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their Subjects, might have a higher cauſe than they could comprehend, and that God Almighty would not have ſubjected ſo many to the power of one man, had not he reſolved to take particular care to direct him. In the mean time the Counteſs <hi>de la Moriene</hi> repairs with all ſpeed to <hi>Thonon,</hi> as the Duke had prudently foreſeen. The Marqueſs went out to receive her, and intreated ſhe would be pleaſed to accept of his Appartment. When ſhe was arrived, Well, Madam, ſaid he, you are now at <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non?</hi> the Court muſt be your ordinary Reſidence; the Deſerts where my Love found you out firſt, muſt have the honour of poſſeſſing you no longer, and the effects of your Beauty hath given you the ſame authority with the Duke, as you had before with the Marqueſs of <hi>Savona</hi> only. What do you mean by effects of Beauty, replied the Counteſs, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the Duke? Are theſe the marks of his kindneſs, which make you jealous? Ha! Madam, replied the Marqueſs, you are not yet acquainted
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65131:126"/>with the Intrigue, the Duke was in Love with you as ſoon as ever he ſaw you; your Husbands offence is but a pretence to get you hither, and the Count <hi>de la Moriene</hi> had never been a Priſoner, but that you might be forced to ſollicite for his inlargement.</p>

               <p>The Counteſs gave no Credit at firſt to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes Diſcourſe, ſhe imagined it nothing but the artificial terrour of a prying Lover, to whom every thing gives occaſion of Jealouſie; and not thinking of any thing but the buſineſs ſhe came about, ſhe deſired the Marqueſs to preſent her to the Duke. The Duke received her very ſupercilliouſly, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to play the part of an offended Soveraign, and gave her juſt cauſe to tell the Marqueſs he was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in his Conjecture, and that an amorous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as he had repreſented himſelf, could not be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſo much auſtery. But not long after meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her at the Counteſs of <hi>Geneva</hi>'s, his Siſters Houſe, he took her into a Terrace to ſhew her the Proſpect: And to ſpeak truth the pretence was well laid, for doubtleſs it is one of the beſt and moſt pleaſant in the World. The firſt Object which preſents it ſelf is the Lake of <hi>Leman,</hi> with two or three Villages upon the ſide of it, from whence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiating
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65131:126"/>upon certain Mountains, ſome of them barren, others more beholden to Nature, but all covered with Snow; it begins to abate upon the ruines of a Triumphal Arch, which ſeem as left there on purpoſe to make that Proſpect ſuperlative. The Counteſs having obſerved all of them with a moſt judicious diſcernment, gave the Duke an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity as he deſired himſelf. A Lady that could not ſo well have diſtinguiſht the pleaſures of this Province, as you have done, Madam, ſaid he to her, would have preferred this Proſpect before the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable Walks of a ſolitary Wood, and yet you, Madam, are not of that opinion, for I dare lay a Wager, the Caſtles of the Count <hi>de la Moriene</hi> pleaſe you much better, than the place where you are. I am contented, Sir, where-ever Fortune diſpoſes me, replied the Counteſs, I have always been told we muſt conform to her humour and Capricio, if we would live quietly without agitation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Sir, as ſhe hath hitherto given me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand I am born for the Caſtles of the Count <hi>de la Moriene,</hi> and not for <hi>Thonnon,</hi> I muſt confeſs to your Higneſs one of my greateſt Requeſts to her is, that I may obtain a ſudden diſmiſſion, and return to my old Deſerts again. But, Madam, replied the Prince, if this Fortune you ſpeak of ſhould cauſe you to change your Deſerts for the Court, would you appeal from her Decrees? and notwithſtanding your inclination and promptitude to live with the Count, could you not be as happy with the Duke of <hi>Savoy?</hi> I never, Sir, create Chimeras to my ſelf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Counteſs, I am ordained to live with the Count <hi>de la Moriene,</hi> and not to ſuch Honour as
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65131:127"/>your Highneſs propoſes: ſuffer me, I beſeech you, to bound my deſires with my power. You know not your ſelf how far your power extends, Madam, replied the Duke, I know the effects of it much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than you; and if your deſires be accordingly, you ſhall have as much felicity in having captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to your Charms, as you had power to do it: You do but ſport your ſelf, Sir, with my misfortunes, replied the Counteſs, and add your mirth to the calamity of my Husbands impriſonment. If, Madam, replied the Prince, you believe not what I ſay, I muſt give you a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and then calling the Marqueſs of <hi>Savona</hi> to him, who was about four paces off, ſo mad and tranſported with Jealouſie, he was a hundred times ready to run in, and interrupt them. He command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to tell the Counteſs what he knew of his affection for her; If it was not true that he loved her at firſt ſight, that ever ſince it hath daily increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that now it was at that height, there was nothing in his power but ſhe might promiſe her ſelf from its violence. It was a hard task for <hi>Savona</hi> to aſſure his Miſtreſs of the Love of his Rival: He did all that was poſſible to have evaded it; he told the Duke there was no need of further evidence where he had affirmed, for his own aſſertion was above all other Authority. No, no, replied the Prince; 'tis not an Elogy I deſire at your hands, tell me ſincerely without theſe Prologues, what you know of my Love. His Command was ſo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and uncapable of delay, he was forced to ſpeak and tell whatever the Duke pleaſed the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs ſhould know. This Diſcourſe was made with
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:65131:127"/>ſo much conſtraint, the Marqueſs is to be excuſed in whatever he ſaid; but the Counteſs taking it in dudgeon, reproacht him by his Compliance in moſt biting and acrimonious terms. You ought, ſaid ſhe to him Ironically, your ſelf have delivered me up to the deſires of the Duke, there wanted nothing but that exceſs of obedience, for you to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged your ſelf honourably; you were the firſt who brought me the News of <hi>Amedy</hi>'s Love; your perpetual ſuſpicions aſſure me of its perſeverance, and that he might be ſure not to be ignorant that you had told me, you confirm in his preſence, what you told me in private, Compleat all, good Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Savona,</hi> and go and tell him the ways you took to ſurpriſe me your ſelf, you owe that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the benefits of ſo incomparable a Maſter. The Marqueſs alledged ſeveral Arguments in his defence, but he could not prevail with her to admit them: As one is always innocent, whilſt he pleaſes, ſo when he begins to diſpleaſe, he is always to blame. The Counteſs had taken up a fancy, that the Marqueſs was culpable; and to perfect the ruine of his affairs, <hi>Amedy</hi> having Intelligence that the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> was at <hi>Lyons,</hi> ſent the Marqueſs of <hi>Savona</hi> thither, to make his Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from him. The Duke was obliged to him for the Erection of <hi>Savoy</hi> into a Dutchy, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Title only of a County, till the ſaid Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Journey into <hi>France</hi> in the year 1416. and could not do leſs than teſtifie his acknowledgments by that Embaſſie; and this Commiſſion being one of the moſt honourable in <hi>Amedy</hi>'s donation, he caſt his eyes upon his Favourite as the moſt proper
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65131:128"/>Perſon to receive it. At another time he would have accepted it with thanks, but then he lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as the fatal period of his Amours. He would fain have expreſt his apprehenſions to the Counteſs, and have conjured her to have oppoſed them; but ſhe cut him ſhort ſtill with this, Have you not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the Duke, ſaid ſhe ſmiling, to come and tell me from him, that he is reſolved to take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of your abſence, and that it is upon that deſign you are ſent away? I remember when firſt you told me of his Love, you did it with ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of fear, and I expect to ſee you called in for a Witneſs at your return, of all you are pleaſed to communicate ſo ſlyly at your departure. Ha! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, cryed the Marqueſs of <hi>Savona,</hi> you know at your heart with what deſign I declared the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> Love to you at firſt, and with what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign I now deſire you to be cautious of its progreſs. I know no more, replied the Counteſs, but that very imprudently you told me <hi>Amedy</hi> was in Love with me; that ſince you have confirmed it before his face, and that now you prognoſticate your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. If I may judge of your Propheſie by what is paſt, this pretended deſtruction is concluded already betwixt the Duke and you, and you do but prepare me as to an infallible thing. A Farewel with ſo little kindneſs, ought not to leave the heart of the Counteſs ſo well fortified, as to reſiſt the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taques of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and therefore ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her ſelf to be vanquiſht without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reſiſtance; the talk of the World was her greateſt diſcouragement, and the Duke wanting neither Examples nor Expedients to diſſipate that
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65131:128"/>ſcruple, the Marqueſs found the Treaty very far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced at his return. The Duke, according to his cuſtom, did him the honour to communicate even this Intrigue with him; he told him the Counteſs hath conjured me to ſay nothing of it to you, and whether ſhe fancies you ſevere as to the deportment of your Kindred, or whether being oftner expoſed to your ſight, than other people, ſhe is unwilling to put her ſelf upon a hazard of bluſhing every time ſhe ſees you, but ſhe ſeems to be more apprehenſive of you, than of all the reſt of the Court: But, my dear <hi>Savona,</hi> you are much better known to me than to the Counteſs, and I ſhould rob you of a greater pleaſure, I am ſure, if I ſhould ſuffer you to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that in three or four days time my deſires will be perfectly ſatisfied. The Marqueſs was ſo diſcompoſed at this diſcourſe, it had like to have betrayed him. Do you ſay, Sir, replied he, that within three or four days you ſhall enjoy the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs <hi>de la Moriene?</hi> Yes, ſaid the Duke, and I had enjoyed her before this, had ſhe not very prudently judged, that (to put the better face upon my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to viſit her) it would be neceſſary to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit her ſelf ill, and ſhe pretends to be ill at this very moment; my Phyſitian hath order to give out her life is in danger, and my Siſter commiſerating the report, is to be the firſt that ſhall tell me the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs is ſick with grief upon her Husbands Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that I owe ſo much to her Quality and Sex, as to beſtow one conſolatory Viſit upon her, to recompence in ſome ſort the affliction I have given her. Is it poſſible? juſt Heavens! replied the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, according to the ſudden dictates of his
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65131:129"/>thoughts. How now! whence this aſtoniſhment, cryed the Duke, interrupting him, did you believe the Enterpriſe more difficult, or had the Counteſs reaſon, when ſhe ſuſpected your niceneſs about the purity of your blood? No, Sir, replied <hi>Savona,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting himſelf; but I believed the Conqueſt as troubleſom as glorious, and in the paſſion I have for your intereſts, cannot but admire the Counteſs ſhould be conquered ſo cheap. Nay, replied <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> I found her high enough of her ſelf; but a Prince of my Quality and Age, ought not to meet with one moments reſiſtance. When a Soveraign Prince is born, it is to command all that are about him, and I am reſolved for the future to put the Ladies of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> into a more commodious poſture, than they at preſent are in. Having ſpoke theſe words, the Duke left him, and went to ſee the Counteſs of <hi>Geneva;</hi> the Marqueſs retired to his own Appartment, ſo confuſed and tranſported with rage, I cannot without crime repeat the flagitious deſigns he had at that time in his head. He would go to the treacherous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, reproach her by her Treaſon, and if he could not hinder the execution of her promiſe, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſtab her, even before the face of the Duke: Sometimes he would ſteal her away, ſometimes kill himſelf; and if any thing worſe preſented it ſelf to his thoughts, he would do it immediately: But his reaſon at length overcoming theſe effluctions, he concluded to deliver the Count <hi>de la Moriene,</hi> if he could, and cauſe him to carry away his Wife. The deſign is too large to be particularized here, but the execution was not ſo difficult as might have been imagined. Since the Counteſs became tractable,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65131:129"/>her Husband was not guarded with that ſtrictneſs as before: The Duke who underſtood himſelf well enough, and had cauſed the ſaid Count to be arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a reaſon which was almoſt effected, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered he ſhould not keep him long in Priſon: He lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only upon the common deſign, and it was with him as with the greateſt part of his Sex, his felicity was never at any great diſtance from his diſguſt. The Counteſs lodged in the Marqueſſes Appartment, and <hi>Thonnon</hi> was rather a Houſe of Pleaſure than Defence. The Marqueſs made an excuſe to <hi>Thurin;</hi> he viſited the Count <hi>de la Moriene,</hi> acquainted him with what had paſſed, and giving him a true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the danger his life and Fortune were in, they agreed upon the ways, and what Refuge the Count was to take. The Officer who guarded the Priſoner, was one of the Marqueſs his Creatures, to whom (as many others did alſo) he ought both his place and his life. Things being ſo well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at <hi>Thurin,</hi> the Marqueſs returned to <hi>Thonnon;</hi> he placed more of his Creatures at the door of the Appartment where the Counteſs lay, which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a Garden from whence they might eaſily make the Lake; he ordered theſe people to open this door upon a Signal agreed betwixt the Count and he; he had taken care to have a Boat provided, and lye ready till they came. The buſineſs ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well as they could deſire, the Count was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of Priſon, and brought privately one night into his Wifes Chamber; he acquainted her that from very good hands he had Intelligence the Duke had ill deſigns upon her Perſon; he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be perſwaded ſhe knew not of them her ſelf.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:65131:130"/>ſuppoſing a poſitive charge might have affrighted her too much; and commanding her to follow, ſhe ſaw ſo much in the old mans face that he would be obeyed, that ſhe durſt neither cry out nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. He conveyed her to the Bark, and from the Water, in a Coach well guarded; the Marqueſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving placed freſh Guards at convenient diſtances. When he judged the Fugitives too far off to be overtaken, he was the firſt that carried the News to the Prince: I always thought, ſaid he to him, the Conqueſt of the Counteſs was too cheap to be certain; ſhe hath pretended to comply, to delude your Highneſs with the more ſecurity; and would ſcarce have been ſo tractable, but to compaſs her deſigns without ſuſpicion: ſhe hath got her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band out of Priſon, and hath ſo contrived it, ſhe hath made him ſteal away her. It is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt the trouble this relation gave <hi>Amedy;</hi> he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all his Family to mount immediately and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue: Bring me, ſaid he, alive or dead that impudent Fellow, who after he had ſo highly offended me, durſt be ſo audacious as to break Priſon himſelf, and out of my own Houſe force away his Wife, whom I had kept there as a Hoſtage for him, he ſhall periſh, and all his Accomplices, though my own Son were in the number. From theſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick diſcourſes paſſing to private, Do not you think me the unhappieſt man alive, <hi>Savona,</hi> ſaid the Prince to his Favourite, to loſe this Woman the very night before I was to enjoy her? To morrow, to morrow, my dear Marqueſs, my deſires ſhould have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, ſhe would have conſented, and the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was appointed for that bleſſed Enterview.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65131:130"/>Do you not perceive, Sir, replied the Marqueſs, that ſhe conſented no further, but to make her pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſent ineffectual at laſt? Ha! <hi>Savona, Savona,</hi> cryed the Duke, ſhe conſented in good earneſt, I know it by the motions and variations of her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, ſhe loved me entirely, and I date ſwear the poor Woman was carried away in ſpight of her teeth, would you had ſeen with what kindneſs ſhe received the aſſurances of my paſſion; and what proteſtations ſhe made me of her own. Theſe words toucht the Marqueſs to the Soul, he had need of all his temper and ambition, to reſtrain himſelf from breaking out; and had not the conſideration of the condition of his Rival qualified his anger, there had been nothing ſo deſperate but he would have attempted. In the mean time, thoſe who were ſent after the Counteſs, contrary to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes preſumption, overtook her: Their Coach had been overturned; they had had ſome other diſaſters in their Equipage: and the Counteſs lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Thonnon</hi> much againſt her will, had counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited her ſelf ill ſo artificially, that all the Frontier were ſtopt, before the Count could get at them They were arreſted upon the Frontiers of <hi>Dauphin,</hi> where the Count had deſigned his retreat. When he underſtood the Dukes Guards inquired for him, he barricadoed himſelf in the Inn, reſolved to periſh before he would ſurrender. The perſons ſent after him, having expreſs Orders to bring him dead or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, never ſtood upon Complements, they preſt him ſo cloſe, there was no poſſibility of eſcaping: and thoſe who are far gone in Stoiciſm, being not far from Barbarity, the Count took up a reſolution ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65131:131"/>to the fierceneſs of his own Nature, and his hatred for <hi>Amedy.</hi> He killed the fair Counteſs, and ſtab'd himſelf when he had done.</p>
               <p>Let the Reader imagine, if he pleaſes, the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Duke was in at this horrible News. He ſaid, and he did things very inconſiſtent with his Dignity; but that which gave the higheſt tincture to his deſpair, was, to underſtand that it was his dear Favourite, the Marqueſs of <hi>Savona,</hi> had given him this bob. The Count reproaching the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs by the way, had let fall ſome words which aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her of the truth, which words ſhe had writ down in her Table-book (found in her Pocket af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe was dead) with deſign to ſend them by the firſt opportunity to the Duke. The Prince, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf betrayed, to ſatisfie his Revenge, uſed all the means a juſt indignation and an abſolute power could invent. He cauſed the Marqueſs to be ſtab'd, he confiſcated the Count <hi>de la Morienes</hi> Eſtate, and annext it to his demeaſneſs: and not being able ever after to be reconciled to the World, he reſigned the Government into the hands of his Son <hi>Charles,</hi> whom he married to the Princeſs of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> and retiring to his ſolitude of <hi>Ripaille,</hi> he remained there till he was made Anti-Pope. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this receſs he compoſed his Memoires, out of which we have taken this Relation. The general Hiſtory ſays only this, that <hi>Amady</hi> retired upon ſome ſecret diſcontent, but gives no account of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. Our Annals of Love ſupply that defect, as they have done ſeveral other, and could have carried their diſquiſition much further, if they might have been permitted: An Anti-pope of the

The Prince obtained no favour from the King, but what he ought to his Complacence for the Queen; and, as the higheſt exceſs of her Tyranny, ſhe would conſtrain him to marry a Daughter of hers called <hi>Leonora,</hi> which ſhe had had by her firſt Husband <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Arragon.</hi> The Lady was handſom, and had not <hi>Don Pedro</hi> been under a neceſſity of loving her, it is poſſible he would have loved her well enough; but Love is hardly to be obtruded upon a generous Soul. <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s natural inclinations were great, his Courage-high, he could not truckle to the Orders of the Queen; and the more eager ſhe was to force his affection for the Princeſs, he was the more obſtinate and averſe. He had a Nurſe (widow to the Marqueſs <hi>de Caſtro</hi>) who had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon him. In all the Countries on that ſide the Mountains, the Nurſes are choſen as choſen as much by their Extraction, as any other Qualification what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65131:132"/>They have an opinion, that the inclinations of ordinary Women are transfuſed with their milk: and I am not certain whether it be altogether irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. The Queen accumultated her Careſſes and Preſents upon this Lady, and conjured her to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the utmoſt of her intereſt to diſpoſe the young Prince to what ſhe deſired; but who is it but knows how much Fortune delights to defeat the deſigns of humane Prudence? The way the Queen propoſed to make her project ſucceſsful, proved the greateſt and moſt effectual obſtruction. This Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes Lady had a Daughter named <hi>Agnes,</hi> a ſprightly and handſom young Lady. The Prince had ſeen her without any Concernment, whilſt he had viewed her <hi>en paſſant,</hi> but the Commiſſion her Mother had received from the Queen, giving him more frequent occaſions of entertaining her. the Prince became enamour'd at laſt. What he had ſuckt from the breaſt of her Mother, fermented in his heart in favour to the Daughter, and the Love which was produced from ſo natural a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, was violent from its very beginning. The Prince was not able to ſuffer without declaring it. The Terms in which he did it, were not diſpleaſing to the young <hi>Caſtro;</hi> and being a handſom man in his perſon, it coſt him no great trouble to inſinuate into her affection; the greateſt diſcouragement ſhe had, was their uncertainty of her Mother. She was a Woman entirely devoted to the Intereſt of the Royal Family; ſhe would not ſee her own Daughter advanced to the Throne, at the expence of the leaſt difference betwixt the King and his Son; and being not of a Temper to be eaſily delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65131:132"/>
                  <hi>Agnes</hi> was perſwaded ſhe would not endure the paſſion of the Prince. She repreſented her Judgment to him, and though of her ſelf ſhe could have heard them eternally, yet ſhe conjured him for thoſe reaſons to give over that diſcourſe. But thoſe kind of Conjurations are always in vain; a Lover is never ſo furious, as where reaſons are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to perſwade him to the contrary. The Princes paſſion was augmented by this difficulty; but to accommodate with the prudence of <hi>Anges,</hi> which he could not deny to be upon very good grounds, he reſolved to counterfeit an affection for the Princeſs of <hi>Arragon,</hi> but with this contrivance, that whatever he ſhould be forced to ſay to <hi>Leonora;</hi> ſhould be received by <hi>Agnes</hi> as intended to her, and the progreſſes he made upon the heart of the one, ſhould be conſtantly placed upon the account of the other. This reſolution being taken, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions agreed, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> pretended to comply with his Nurſes advice. The King and the Queen overjoy'd with this change, advanced the whole Family of the Marchioneſs, and made a thouſand Preſents to <hi>Agnes.</hi> It was a rare thing, and very much to the Reputation of Love, of Lovers of that Age to delude the Dagacity of two wiſe and intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Women, and a King accompliſhed in all the Myſteries of Government; but that which was moſt pleaſant of all, was the blindneſs of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who knowing her ſelf handſom enough to be beloved, and receiving the ſame-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which the Prince, if he durſt, would have made to the young <hi>Caſtro,</hi> made many acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to her Rival for her aſſiſtance, without ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65131:133"/>the leaſt. One night when in the preſence of <hi>Agnes</hi> the Prince beg'd a kiſs of <hi>Leonora</hi> ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, he was in a fair way to have prevailed: Not ſo faſt, Madam, if you pleaſed, cryed the young <hi>Caſtro,</hi> you do not conſider what you are about to do; there are more perſons concerned in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, than perhaps you imagine, and you muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for my Vertue, if you expoſe your own in things unworthy of your Modeſty. The Princeſs, who knew nothing of the agreement betwixt <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> and the Prince, being ſurpriſed, askt her, how ſhe became reſponſable for her Vertue; Do you not know, Madam, replied <hi>Agnes,</hi> that Perſons of your Eminence and Extraction, are to be Examples to all their Inferiours? I look upon you, Madam, as my Model, and had I a Servant, I ſhould think I might do any thing innocently, that I ſaw you do before me with the Prince. Yes indeed, replied the Princeſs, you might do it innocently enough, I never condemn that in another, which I practiſe my ſelf, and I do not think I had tranſgreſſed the bounds of Civility ſo far, but I might have been imitated by all the Women in the World. The Prince durſt not interpoſe in their Converſe; he did not at firſt diſcern what <hi>Agnes</hi> intended, and when he had, he durſt not contradict her for fear of diſcovering the Secret: But when he ſaw the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion dccided in his favour, and that by the mouth of the Princeſs, he made a ſudden acclamation, magnified her Equity, as he called it, and after that day <hi>Leonora</hi> did nothing in obedience to the Orders of the Queen, but <hi>Don Pedro</hi> exacted the ſame from the kindneſs of <hi>Agnes:</hi> If he received an obliging
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65131:133"/>Letter from <hi>Leonora,</hi> See, Madam, ſaid he to the young <hi>Caſtro,</hi> the Princeſs ſhews you what you are to do to your Servant. If the Princeſs gave him a Braſſelet, you may learn by this, ſaid the Prince to <hi>Agnes,</hi> you are to gratifie your Servant, the Princeſs has given you an Example, and it will be injuſtice in you not to follow it. The deluded Princeſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed all the Prince did already, and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> abuſing her Errour, made her moſt pitileſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſentence many times againſt her ſelf: But this kind of Recreation was too pleaſant to laſt long. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had made a Paper of Verſes for <hi>Agnes</hi> under the Name of <hi>Leonora,</hi> and reſolved to preſent them to the Princeſs in earneſt when <hi>Agnes</hi> had ſeen them, but <hi>Agnes</hi> having a deſire to keep, and conſider them a while, unhappily the Verſes dropt one day out of her Pocket, and were brought to <hi>Leonora</hi> before the Prince could bring them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Leonora</hi> thought they had been loſt, and took great pains to remember what ſhe had done with them, when the Prince came in and preſented them to her again. In ſearching for other papers, he had found them in his Pockets; and thinking it never unſeaſonable to make a Preſent, he brought them to <hi>Leonora</hi> in great haſte, as if they had been finiſht but juſt then. The Princeſs bluſht when ſhe knew them, and being told by the perſon that found them, that they fello out of <hi>Agnes</hi>'s Pocket; You will do me a pleaſure, Sir, ſaid ſhe to the Prince, not to give any thing to another body that is intended for me. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> aſſured her he had obeyed her before-hand, and that thoſe Verſes had never been ſhown but to her: and perſiſting in
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65131:134"/>that ſtory, the Princeſs began to be angry, went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Queens Chamber, and gave her an account of what had paſt. The wiſe Queen found matters of ſuſpicion, which the unexperienced <hi>Leonora</hi> had not diſcovered: There was a kind of a Love-knot in the Verſes of <hi>Agnes,</hi> which were not in thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to <hi>Leonora,</hi> and the Name of the Princeſs writ in another Character. There wanted no more to perſwade the Queen of the truth: She ſent for the Prince, and told him, that he had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Hypocriſie very ill; that the Marchioneſs of <hi>Caſtro</hi> and her Daughter, were too ſenſible to be acceſſory to his diſobedience; that it was by the Kings expreſs Orders <hi>Agnes</hi> had pretended to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his proteſtations, and to teſtifie what ſhe ſaid, ſhe had preſented to the King the very ſame day the laſt Verſes he had made for her. This fetch ſucceeded as the Queen could deſire, the Prince bluſht, and ſaying only he could not have thought young <hi>Agnes</hi> ſo perfidious, by his ſilence he ſeemed to conſent to the whole accuſation. The Queen taking up an opinion the Marchioneſs had betray'd her, gave the King notice of her ambitious deſigns; upon which ſhe and her Daughter both were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the Court, and the Prince murmuring againſt that prohibition; they doubled their rigour, and interdicted him the liberty of ſeeing them at home. The Prince perceiving by that what a Trick they had plaid him, ſwore he would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged, threatned the Queen in the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and forbore viſiting <hi>Leonora</hi> any more. But all this would not ſatisife the Marchioneſs, her Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius lay for the Court, and ſhe could not live out
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65131:134"/>of the Verge of it. She writ to the Queen, and proteſted the two Lovers had deceived her; and to make good what ſhe affirmed, ſhe promiſed to watch them more narrowly for the future, and give her Majeſty a faithful account of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. In the mean time the Prince could not live without <hi>Agnes,</hi> he wanted not ſuch as carried his Letters, and returned him her Anſwers. This kind of convenience would have been a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to one which had never been happier, but in Love all deſcents are precipices, and all ſtumblings are falls. He conſidered that the Marchioneſs houſe ſtood cloſe by a Park-wall, which joyned to the Gardens of the Palace, and that <hi>Agnes</hi>'s Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had the proſpect on that ſide. He gave <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> notice of the commodity, and having furniſht himſelf with a Ladder of Cord, he went every night out of his Chamber when his Servants were aſleep, and without the company of any (but one of his Officers who lay without in the Wardrobe) repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under his <hi>Agnes</hi>'s Window. They had much and frequent diſcourſe, and that ſo kind. The Confident of theſe Enterviews imagining they might be further improved to his Maſters ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, reſolved what he could to drive them to the height. He was an old Fornicator, and had had many an Intrigue paſt through his hands in his time, he apprehended the Princes deſires would be ſatiated with injoying her, and knowing that thoſe deſires were diſpleaſing to the King, he concluded he ſhould do both King and Maſter good ſervice, if he could put an end to theſe Conferences. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided himſelf of another Ladder, hid it in a Hedge
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65131:135"/>near <hi>Agnes</hi>'s Windows, and obſerving one night by the Ladies diſcourſe, that that was a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conjecture for his deſigns: To what purpoſe, Sir, ſaid he to the Prince, is this ſpinning of time, when you may diſpatch all, if you pleaſe? Mount, mount, Sir, and go to her, and do what you have to do nearer hand, and then ſet up his Ladder. This counſel was pleaſing, and the Prince (the Window being low) was at the upper end of the Ladder, as ſoon as his Confident had propoſed it; <hi>Agnes</hi> was diſcreet, and no having ſuſpected ſuch an Attaque, ſhe could not receive it without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: ſhe retired immediately to the next Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, from thence into the Hall, and thence down the ſtairs. The Prince followed her as cloſe as he could; but not knowing the turnings of the Houſe, and the Fugitive being ſtill ſome diſtance before, there was always a Chamber betwixt them. Young <hi>Agnes</hi> without doubt could have wiſht he had been nearer, and began already to fear leſt he ſhould hurt himſelf in the dark, and as if the ſtairs had been the bounds of her apprehenſion, ſhe was juſt thinking of returning from whence ſhe came; but ſhe was prevented in that by her Mother and the Princeſs of <hi>Arragon.</hi> Her Mother did not believe the Princes deſires were lawful, nor (if they had) that they could have ever-been executed, and therefore had kept her Parole very punctually with the Queen. She had watcht the two Lovers ſo cloſe, ſhe had diſcovered their nocturnal Entertainments: ſhe had given faithful advertiſement, and <hi>Leonora</hi> like an inraged Lover, delighting to reproach his Treaſon to the Traitor himſelf, got leave of the Queen that
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65131:135"/>ſhe might lye privately in the Marchioneſſes Houſe, and if poſſible, catch her Gallant in the fact. At ſo an unexpected apparition, <hi>Agnes</hi> gave a skreek, and would have run to the Prince to have ſaved her, but her Mother ſtopt her, and giving her a twirl by the Elbow, thruſt her towards the next Chamber: As ſhe opened the door, there came ſo ſudden a guſt of wind out of it, as blew out the Marqueſſes Candle; ſhe was afraid her Daughter ſhould have eſcaped in that interval, and having a mind to ſurpriſe the Prince, whom nevertheleſs ſhe believed to be under the Window, ſhe ſeized upon <hi>Agnes</hi> her ſelf, and would not let her ſtir, till a new light was brought. <hi>Leonora</hi> committing the care of ſecuring the young <hi>Caſtro</hi> to her Mother, ſlipt privately without any noiſe into the Chamber from whence her Rival came out. The Prince by the glimmering of the Moon (which was then ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing) was juſt got thither, and taking <hi>Leonora</hi> for the perſon he purſued, he threw himſelf upon her, and clipt her in his Arms with as much ardour as could be expected from the affection of an amorous young man: Dear <hi>Agnes,</hi> ſaid he to the Princeſs, why do you withdraw from my affections? are you not ſenſible of their purity? I ſwear, <hi>Agnes,</hi> and I call Heaven to witneſs, my deſign is nothing elſe but to ſet the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> upon your Head; ſweeten this attempt of mine with ſome expreſſion of your kindneſs, and truſt your ſelf for once to the faith of a Perſon that adores you: You are not ignorant of my paſſion, you are acquainted with all the fallacies I have put upon <hi>Leonora,</hi> the indeed inhumane way I have taken to make her a
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65131:136"/>blind and a cover for my affection to you; and the little advantage I have made of her Errours, have given you an entire proſpect of my Soul. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence of the Princes intentions made him a little bold, he interrupted his diſcourſes with ſome little exorbitances, and ſo reſolute he was to make <hi>Agnes</hi> his Wife, that doubtleſs he would have preſumed to have anticipated in ſome points, had not the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs came into the Chamber with her Candle. It is no eaſie matter to determine who was in the greateſt Conſternation, the Princeſs to have heard the Princes Diſcourſs, the Marchioneſs to find <hi>Don Pedro</hi> where he was, and the Prince at the Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both of the one and the other. For ſome time they were all of them amazed, and ſtood gazing one upon another without ſpeaking a word; but at length old <hi>Caſtro</hi> coming firſt to her tongue, ſhe accoſted him thus: How! Sir, ſaid ſhe to the Prince, and is it true that you make no ſcruple of ſullying the Honour of a Perſon, which gave you your firſt nouriſhment? Is this, Sir, my recompence for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving born you ſo often, and with ſo much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, at my boſom? Ha! Sir, could I ever have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected this treatment from <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> or from the Son of the Great King <hi>Alphonſo?</hi> Was I then to be the Victime of your ſecret paſſions, added the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, did I ſerve but as a ſtale and pretence, and was it only for the Love of <hi>Agnes</hi> you pretended to love me? The Prince at this ſecond Charge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Service too hot, quitted the field, and having with great ſpeed ſecured his Ladder, he reſcued himſelf from the reproaches of two outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Women. This Adventure made as much
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:65131:136"/>noiſe in the Court as could be expected from the fury of the Queen, and the Authority ſhe had uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped over the Spirit of the King. The promiſes which <hi>Don Pedro</hi> made by miſtake to <hi>Leonora,</hi> interfering with the Power of the King, there was no kind of reprehenſion but it drew upon the Prince; thoſe appearances of Love wherewith he had abuſed the Princeſs of <hi>Arragon,</hi> giving occaſion of offence to the Royal Family from whence ſhe was deſcended, puſht on the Queen in her murmurs and threats, even to an exceſs: ſhe exclaimed againſt the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of that inſolence, and nothing could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair it but either the Prince muſt marry her imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, or elſe the King muſt give her leave to retire with her Daughter into the Kingdom of <hi>Arragon.</hi> The Marchioneſs her ſelf, who by <hi>Leonora</hi>'s condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was become clearly of her ſide, and deſired his Majeſty to aſſign her a Husband for her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, declaring that after ſuch contumacy as ſhe had committed, it was but reaſon ſhe ſhould expect one no where elſe but from the bounty of the King. The Prince endeavoured to diſ-entangle himſelf as well as he could; ſometimes he ſtormed like a mad man, ſometimes he ſubmitted, ſometimes he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to attempt any thing for the vindication of his liberty, and then again he would call for quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to purchaſe a little repoſe. The King obſerving his diſorder to increaſe, and that the more violent it became, the more it was oppoſed, he thought no way ſo ſure to put an end to it, as to cauſe <hi>Agnes</hi> to be killed. She dyed, as the Queen gave out, of the ſmall Pox, but the more learned Authors are of opinion it was by poyſon. It is eaſie to conceive
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65131:137"/>
                  <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s diſtraction at ſo Tragical an accident, he reſolved to revenge himſelf upon whom ever he did but ſuſpect to have an hand in it, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dying juſt in the nick, hence it was there aroſe an irreconciliable quarrel betwixt the two Crowns of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Portugal. Don Pedro</hi> ſacrificed ten years War, and ſo much blood to the Ghoſt of his dear <hi>Agnes,</hi> as might well have given him the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Cruel, had not the gentleneſs of the latter end attoned for the beginning of his Raign.</p>
               <p>THere was another <hi>Agnes</hi> living almoſt about the ſame time,<note place="margin">The Counteſs of <hi>Pontieuvre.</hi>

The trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which happened in his Raign, are not my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in this place: There are Authors enough have related the Invaſion of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Exploits performed by the <hi>Pucelle</hi> in their expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; I will concern my ſelf no further than the Amours of this <hi>Agnes.</hi> The <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> known ſince by the Name of <hi>Lewix</hi> XI. endured with great impatience the Power this Woman had uſurpt upon his Father. He acted nothing but by her Counſels; he gave her the Barony of <hi>Pontieuvre</hi> '(which till then was always an Appanage of the youngeſt Sons of the Royal Family) and all Favours and Offices in the Kingdom paſt through her hands. A great part of her Influence ſhe imployed in oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prince, and omitted nothing which might mitigate the animoſity he had againſt her; but the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65131:137"/>Kings Preſents paſſing through her hands, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with poyſon. He had tryed ſeveral ways to deſtroy her, but none ſucceeded; however he would not give over, but reſolved upon another he believed more infaillible. He had a Favourite cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chaubannes,</hi> Count of <hi>Dammartin,</hi> the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt young Lord in all the Court; he propoſed it to him to make Love to her, and knowing his Fathers Jealouſie, he doubted not but he ſhould ruine the Counteſs, if he could convince her of the leaſt infidelity. He imparted his deſign to the Count, and conjured his concurrence. The Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition at firſt appeared to be dangerous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Dauphin what Expedient he had thought of to ſecure him againſt his Fathers indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if his deſign ſhould happen to be ſuſpected. The real Service you will do him thereby, replied the Prince: We will tell him that ſhe had ſollicited you a long time, that the fear of being the Author of ſuch ill News, had hindred you from diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and that you did hope in time to have tired out her importunities by your averſion? but that perceiving what you deſigned to extinguiſh thoſe flames, did but kindle and augment them, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it your duty now to give him notice of all. Poſſeſt, as he is, of the fidelity of <hi>Agnes,</hi> he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps queſtion the report; you will ask him what proof he deſires, and then whatever is paſt, or whatever you hope for the future, will be but the conſequences of his Orders. Upon. theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>Chabannes</hi> complied: He had a <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> called S. <hi>Colombe,</hi> of whoſe fidelity he had had ample experience; he cauſed him to open
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65131:138"/>Scene with <hi>Mortaing</hi> the Counteſſes Woman, who was privy to all her Miſtreſſes Secrets. S. <hi>Colombe</hi> counterfeited a paſſion immediately, as having that Leſſon by heart, and <hi>Mortaing</hi> was naturally very compaſſionate of other peoples ſufferings. They came preſently to their proteſtations and promiſes, and the Confidencies of the Miſtreſs were not long behind the aſſurances of the Servant. When S. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lombe</hi> found things in the poſture he deſired, he declared the affection his Maſter had for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, and to ſweeten the propoſition he made to her to be ſerviceable to his Maſter; See, dear <hi>Mortaing,</hi> ſaid he to her, beſides the utility which will accure to us both by that Commerce, it is the only way to continue our own, ſooner or later all things are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; and if our Lady comes once to diſcern our Amours (as how can it otherwiſe be) ſhe will never forgive you that, which ſhe looks upon at preſent as a Crime, for, <hi>Mortaing,</hi> it is none to love a King, that makes one the more honourable among men, and I am perſwaded is venial even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gods. Kings are ſo dear to them, I fancy every thing is grateful to them they do; but we that are of a more common Conſtitution, are not to expect the Priviledge of Princes, and can never obtain the Counteſſes indulgence, unleſs we can reduce her to a condition of having need of it her ſelf. <hi>Mortaing</hi> liked S. <hi>Colombes</hi> reaſons very well, and the ſame night as her Miſtreſs was undreſſing, ſhe put her upon a diſcourſe of all the people at Court. There was not one of them could eſcape her cenſure: But when they came to <hi>Chabannes;</hi> Ha! Madam, for him, cryed <hi>Mortaing,</hi> we cannot
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65131:138"/>but ſpeak well; I never ſaw any man ſo compleat, and if I ſhould wiſh my ſelf handſom or great, it ſhould be on purpoſe to love him without being ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous. <hi>Agnes</hi> was well enough perſwaded her Damoiſelle was in the right, the Excellence of his Qualities had not eſcapt her obſervation, and ſhe had long ſince in her heart had a hankering after him; but the Favourites of the Daulphin having but little Commerce with the Miſtreſs of the King, the Count of <hi>Dammartin</hi> had obſerved none of the Simperings and Allurements ſhe made uſe of to inſnare him: Whereupon our Counteſs had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch diſpleaſure, ſhe almoſt abhorred him, and turning away her head at the name of <hi>Chaban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> ſhe interrupted poor <hi>Mortaing</hi> in the midſt of her <hi>Elogium.</hi> Never name that man to me, ſaid ſhe to her, I hate him worſe than death or old age. Theſe words put the Damoiſelle into a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſilence; ſhe withdrew into her Chamber in great confuſion, and was impatient next day to ſee S. <hi>Colombe,</hi> to adviſe him to imploy her no more in ſuch deſperate Commiſſions. S. <hi>Colombe</hi> went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to his Maſter to acquaint him with the ſucceſs of his Embaſſie; the Count was ſurpriſed at the News, he did not remember any thing he had done to diſoblige the Counteſs; he ordered S. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lombe</hi> to ſet his <hi>Mortaing</hi> a work to fiſh out the cauſe of her averſion. At the intreaty of her Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, <hi>Mrtaing</hi> makes a ſecond attempt, but with as little ſatisfaction as before; the Counteſs could not forget the many glances ſhe had loſt, and could not pardon the Count of <hi>Dammartin</hi> that he had never obſerved them. This obſtinacy in the Counteſs
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65131:139"/>nettled the poor Count, and not being accuſtomed to the hatred of fair Ladies, he began to do that out of vanity, which he was unwilling to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken at the ſollicitation of the Prince. The King was at that time at <hi>Tours,</hi> where he reſolved to paſs the whole Winter. The happy way he was in, of recovering the whole Kingdom, put the Court into a diſpoſition to mirth; inſomuch as there was nothing ſpoke of but pleaſure and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments: The Dauphins Wife, who was the King of <hi>Scots</hi> Daughter, young and beautiful, loved her diverſions exceedingly; the Queen was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placent, poſitive in nothing, but complied with whatever ſhe and the reſt were inclined to; and the Dauphin himſelf (having given relaxation to his many diſtractions, in hopes his revenge was at hand) was at that time more addicted to be merry, than he had been accuſtomed to be. <hi>Chabannes</hi> made his advantage of thoſe favourable opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; he danced well, did every thing well, and attaqued the hatred <hi>Agnes</hi> pretended with ſo much addreſs, made her quickly diſcern that what ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted as a real averſion, was but the obliging effect of his modeſty and baſhfulneſs. The Count perceived how things went almoſt as ſoon as the Counteſs, and being an old Sophiſter at that trade, he ſeemed as faſt to retire, as ſhe ſeemed to advance. He knew the frailty of her Sex, that they deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo furiouſly, as what is refuſed them: When he obſerved the Counteſſes Eye fixt upon him, he turned his face another way; if ſhe entertained him with diſcourſe, and turned it upon Love, to give her ſelf opportunity to repreſent the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65131:139"/>on of hers, he talkt of nothing but the indifference of his temper; and the pain it would be to him to love any thing long. At length his wiles had their intended effect; for one night when the whole Court was at the Appartment of Madam <hi>la Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine,</hi> and <hi>Chabannes</hi> in his old way had ſhifted off the oeillades of Madam <hi>la Counteſſe,</hi> ſhe took him aſide towards a Table where there was a Glaſs, and pretending to rectifie her Hood, ſhe askt him why it was he avoided the looks of the Ladies ſo much; I am afraid, Madam, replied he, to ſhew you the object of your diſdain, and I cannot but reſpect you, even where you are unjuſt. <hi>Agnes</hi> bluſht at his anſwer, and remembring what ſhe had ſaid to <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating,</hi> ſhe was impatient to be home, to know upon what grounds that Wench diſcovered to the Count what ſhe had diſcourſed to her in private. She cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to be called as ſoon as ſhe was got to her Chamber, and reproaching her by the lightneſs of her tongue, in the bittereſt language the could think of, ſhe commanded her to tell her truly what it was prevailed with her to be ſo fooliſh. <hi>Mortaing</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing her Miſtreſſes hatred for the Count as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and immortal as ſhe pretended, concluded ſhe had committed a great Crime in entertaining the Propoſitions of his Love: She threw her ſelf down at her feet, told all S. <hi>Colombe</hi> had ſaid to her, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured her to pardon what was paſt, and wiſht a thouſand imprecations, if ever ſhe were guilty again in that nature for the future. There is no great hurt in the bufineſs neither, ſaid Madam <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> ſweetning her again, the Crime was that you concealed it from me, do not you make ſuch Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65131:140"/>another time, for I will have nothing paſs in my Houſe, but I will know it my ſelf: Alas! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, replied the trembling <hi>Mortaing,</hi> I durſt not tell you for my life; for you told me you hated the Count <hi>Dammartin</hi> perfectly. Yes, ſays ſhe, and I do hate him without doubt, but that hinders not but I may be well enough pleaſed to hear he hath a kindneſs for me; it is a way to exerciſe my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge: do you ask his <hi>Valet de Chamber</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of his Love, and when he tells you, give me an account, but be ſure do not let him know I deſire to hear it, for it concerns me much he ſhould be ignorant. <hi>Mortaing</hi> promiſed to keep it moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credly; but ſhe had no Secret ſhe could conceal from her <hi>Colombe. Chabannes</hi> had intelligence of all; and being a while after at a Paſtime in the Queens Appartment, where the men demand a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the Ladies, and give them their anſwer in ſome pretty-conceited Verſe, it fell to his ſhare to ask a Secret from the Counteſs <hi>de Pontieuvre;</hi> when one has ſo much concern for the hatred of people, replied the Counteſs, it is but reaſon they ſhould endeavour to remove it. A wiſe man, replied <hi>Chabannes,</hi> doth nothing without Orders; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive I have yours at this time, and in that opinion he made his Verſes, which the King (though igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the true meaning) cauſed to be ſet, and he and the whole Court ſung nothing elſe for ſome time: and thus have I have rendred them for the ſatisfaction of the Reader.</p>

               <p>The Dauphin perceiving Madam <hi>Agnes</hi> whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Count, was impatient to know what ſhe had ſaid, he took him out therefore into the Garden by Moon-light, to demand what it was. We triumph, dear Prince, we triumph, ſaid the Count to him ſmiling, the Lady is reduced to a Parley already, and it is now our buſineſs to give her an Anſwer: Haſte then and do it, replied the Prince, I ſhall own all my tranquillity to you, if you ruine that Woman; but have a care, ſhew not too much reſpect to her, tell her, that after ſuch decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her hatted as ſhe made, it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite you ſhould have good proofs to aſſure you of the contrary: demand ſome kind Letters from her, tell her you delight in ſuch things, and drive on the buſineſs with all ſpeed to an Aſſignation. You may tell her you deſire that favour but as a fign of her confidence, and, if you will, ſwear ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you will never abuſe it. He concerned himſelf not much whether he had the real injoyment of the Lady, ſo he had but a manifeſt aſſurance to obtain
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65131:141"/>it. To the inſtructions he had given him, the Dauphin added all opportunity imaginable, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged Madam Dauphin to be more frequently with the Counteſs, to pleaſe the King as he pretended, and taking <hi>Chabannes</hi> along with him, he invented ſo many ſpecious ways to ſeparate the Company, that there was few days but he ordered things ſo, there was a particular Entertainment betwixt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Agnes</hi> and the Count. But theſe opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties produced an effect which neither Prince nor <hi>Dammartin</hi> did ever expect: The Counteſs was one of the handſomeſt Ladies in the World, and the Count was of an age that is ſeldom indifferent: He found there was no dallying with Love, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being puniſhed at laſt, and what he intended hypocritically, proved really true. This Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment produced great alterations in his Politicks, he became diſcreet when he was moſt guilty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion, and the Prince could get nothing out of him now, but relations of Madam <hi>Agnes</hi>'s cruelty. Whence comes this ſudden turn? ſaid the Dauphin to him, I thought ſhe had been running head-long upon the Precipice we had prepared for her; who is it has ſtopt her? She has doubtleſs ſome intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of our deſign, replied the Count; Ladies which have had any ſuch affairs in the World, can eaſily diſcriminate betwixt true Love and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is ſtrange, ſaid the Prince, that this Woman ſhould never be faithful, but now when I ſhould make my advantage of her infidelity; I knew ten perſons belonging to the Court (none of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to you) with whom ſhe has communicated in that time: They had more Merit, or more Love
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65131:141"/>than I then, replied the Count ſmiling; But, Sir, ſaid he very ſubtilly, if you have already ſo many aſſurances of the Counteſſes infidelity, what need is there that I conſtrain my ſelf any longer to make Love to her? the Intrigues ſhe has had with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are not they as criminal towards the King, as if I were the Gallant my ſelf? No, ſays the Prince, they are idle, timorous Fellows, and dread the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under <hi>Agnes</hi>'s diſpleaſure; beſides there is no man in the World ſo proper for my Confidence as you, you are the man alive I can truſt without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: You muſt not therefore be diſcouraged, <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bannes,</hi> this Whimſie of hers will be brought off at laſt. The Count promiſed the Prince to redouble his endeavours: and indeed though <hi>Agnes</hi> ſpake no more to him before Company, he plied her ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently when they were alone. He had cauſed Pages Cloaths to be made, of all the conſiderable Liveries of the Court, and pretending Meſſages ſometimes from one, and ſometimes another, there was ſcarce a morning but he brought her a Letter from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Under the Raign of <hi>Charles</hi> VII. the people which wore Liveries, were not ſuch Striplings as now a days they are; no body took a Lacquay, till he had a ſubſtantial beard. Trouſes were taken up afterwards upon Command, as is mentioned in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hiſtories, ſo that <hi>Dammartins bonne mine</hi> was not incompatible with the Dreſs of a Foot-man. One day when he had put himſelf into Madam <hi>la Dauphins</hi> Colours, and according to his Cuſtom, pretended a fictitious Errand from her; he was ſent for up into her Chamber, and being in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with <hi>Agnes</hi> by her Bed-ſide, he forgot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:65131:142"/>and ſpun out his time longer than he ought. The King entred unexpectedly into the Room, and the Prince with him. The Counteſs lay always in the ſame Appartment with the King, never any thing but ſome Gallery or Anti-Chamber betwixt their Lodgings: and to prevent any Conſpiracies, his Guards ſtood always at her door. By a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier from <hi>Guyenne</hi> the King had received News, that the Principal Towns of that Province were reduced to his Obedience: He ran immediately to impart it to the Counteſs, and the Dauphin, being in a good humour at that time, accompanied him in his Viſit: The Chamber was dark, and <hi>Chabannes</hi> had no great difficulty to get out of the Kings ſight; but the Dauphin having a glance of his Livery, and having a Meſſage from the Queen to deliver to his Wife, obliging her to a Viſit after Dinner, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Page to him, and bid him tell his Lady. <hi>Agnes</hi> was in a bodily fear, and indeed had the day been clearer, or the Dauphins Meſſage required an Anſwer, the Counteſs and Page both had been utterly undone, but by good Luck he came off with his Congy. He ran home as faſt as he could to change his Robes, and returning imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the Kings Lodgings, he made a great noiſe of two or three extraordinary things he had done that day, on purpoſe to take off the ſuſpicion of his real occupation. The Dauphin took him home with him to Dinner, and giving him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Viſit he had made to the Kings Miſtreſs, it came into his mind that he found his Wife un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt when he came back: He ſent to her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, if ſhe intended to wait upon the Queen in
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:65131:142"/>that poſture. She was ignorant what he meant, and ſent him word ſhe had received no ſuch Orders from her Majeſty; whereupon he went to her Chamber himſelf, and having given her an account of the Meſſage he ſent her by the Page, he cauſed him to be called, and gave Order he ſhould be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for his neglect. But he could not be ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily obeyed, for none of her Pages had been with Madam <hi>de Pontieuvre,</hi> and his Lady aſſured him it was not in her thoughts to ſend thither that day. The Prince was never ſo amazed in his life; he ſaw a Page in his own Livery talking to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, he thought he heard him tell her, it was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>la Dauphine</hi> which inquired of her health, and yet this Page was not to be found. <hi>Chabannes</hi> did what he could to ſatisfie his Curioſity; he told him there could be no myſtery in a Page who ſuffered himſelf to be ſeen both to the King and him, and that it muſt needs be he miſtook the Colours, and thought another Livery his own: But the Prince had a better opinion of his Eyes, than to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to that. He ſent his Scouts abroad, and it was not long before he had ſome confuſed light of the truth: One morning when <hi>Chabannes</hi> was lockt up with the Prince, and endeavouring to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifice his ſuſpicion, one of the Gentlemen he had imployed in the diſcovery, having been let into his Cloſet; The Page, Sir, ſaid he to the Prince, is no longer a Page, he is now become a Merchant of Laces, and not above two hours ſince he was with Madam <hi>de Pontieuvre</hi> in that Equipage. It may be a Marchant indeed, replied the Count, who was not a little concerned in the ſtory. Pardon me,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:65131:143"/>
                  <hi>Monſieur le Comte,</hi> replied the Gentleman, it is the ſame Page the Dauphin ſaw in his Livery the other day in the Counteſſes Chamber. One of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Guard that I know very well, and one that is no Fool, was Sentinel at Madam <hi>Agnes</hi>'s door that day the Page entred, he found him ſo handſom, he took particular notice of him; and being upon the Guard again to day at the ſame Poſt, he perceived the Page and the Merchant were both one. But, ſaid the Prince, interrupting him, this <hi>Scotch</hi>-man that knew the face of the Page and the Merchant ſo well, doth not he know any perſon about the Court which reſembles them? No, Sir, replied the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, he is a Stranger, and has not been long in his Majeſties Service; but he has promiſed me to examine all people ſo ſtrictly for the future, that without doubt it will not be long before he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers him. This Prophecy made <hi>Chabannes</hi> to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he thought it was upon too probable founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He was very remarkable for the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his preſence, and was the moſt illuſtrious Object in the Court. He diſcourſed at large with the Prince about the buſineſs, and having cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed himſelf of the <hi>Scotch</hi>-mans name, he came to S. <hi>Colombe</hi> to give him notice of what had paſſed, and told him he would ſpare no coſt or pains that might prevent the ill Conſequences he dreaded. S. <hi>Colombe</hi> was no Changling; he need ſpeak but one word, to make him know what was to be done. He went to the Guard-Chamber to find out the <hi>Scot.</hi> He invented a <hi>Scotch</hi> Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy which made them Couſin Germans, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be overjoy'd to ſee him, and the firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65131:143"/>of it, being to give him a glaſs of Wine, he drilled him into a Cabaret, where he had diſpoſed certain Souldiers to quarrel with him. The thing happened as S. <hi>Colombe</hi> had projected, the Guard was killed, and the Contriver of the Enterpriſe withdrew himſelf ſo cleanlily, there was not the leaſt mention of his name. When Fortune ſets her ſelf to be favourable, ſhe does nothing by halves: One of the Souldiers S. <hi>Colombe</hi> imployed in this buſineſs, had been formerly a Servant to <hi>Monſieur de Trimouille,</hi> a Favourite of the Kings. Some perſons of his Family who had been his Fellow-Servants, paſſing through the ſtreet where that Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was committed, and obſerving ſeveral other of the Guards running in to reſcue their Camarade, they thought themſelves obliged to defend their old Companion: This Rencontre caſt the ſcandal of that Act upon the Servants of <hi>Monſieur de la Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouille,</hi> and gave the Prince occaſion to ſuſpect that his Maſter was the principal in the Intrigue. He was almoſt of the ſame ſtature with <hi>Chabannes;</hi> he had black hair, and curled like his; and though the Features of the Count <hi>Dammartin</hi> were better than the others, and his Complexion more lively, yet the Room being duskiſh, they might well be miſtaken. <hi>Monſieur le Dauphin</hi> concluded from hence, it was <hi>Monſieur Trimouille</hi> he had ſeen in the Habit of a Page in Madam <hi>Agnes</hi>'s Lodgings; he hated him before, out of a general hatred he had for all the Kings Favourites, and was glad at his heart of this occaſion to ruine him, and his Fathers Miſtreſs together; 'Tis <hi>Trimouille,</hi> 'tis he, ſaid the Prince to <hi>Chabannes,</hi> I have a confuſed remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65131:144"/>of his very face; and the Murder of the <hi>Scotch</hi>-man by his Servants, is an inexpugnable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. The poor man without doubt would have told, and <hi>Tremouille</hi> having ſo many oppoſite intereſts to reconcile, wanted not his Spies; he knew he was in danger of being diſcovered, and therefore cauſed him that could do it to be killed. <hi>Chabannes</hi> ſeemed to be of the ſame Judgment, he ſeemed to admire with the Prince, that a Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of the Kings ſhould commit ſo great an inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. 'Tis common, replied the Dauphin, Great men are frequently expoſed to the Treachery of their Creatures; for not being able to diſcern whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they love them for themſelves, or for their beneficence, they look upon that as the effect of their Love, which indeed is but the product of their own Intereſt. The Dauphin was naturally violent, and his hatred to the Kings Favourites, raſh, and impetuous: he thought he needed no other Evidence to accuſe <hi>Trimouille,</hi> and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all <hi>Chabannes</hi> could ſay to adviſe him to the contrary, he went forthwith to the King, to advertiſe him of what he thought he had been ſure. But that accuſation came to nothing; it happened the ſame time the Prince affirmed <hi>Trimouille</hi> to have been in Diſguiſe with the Counteſs, he had been at the ſame time ſhut up in Conference with the King about affairs of importance. The King being aſſured of this Circumſtance, made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the whole ſtory but a practice invented for the deſtruction of the Innocent; there was not a reproach nor reprehenſion but the Prince was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to endure: and that ill ſucceſs did but aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65131:144"/>and exſtimulate his Curioſity. He doubled his vigilance, and ſpent whole nights petrolling about <hi>Agnes</hi>'s Lodgings. One night among the reſt as he was upon the Watch by a private pair of ſtairs (which he was informed was the way by which the two Lovers correſponded) he perceived a man to aſcend in the Habit of Citizen, with a parcel of Books under his Arm, and by the light of a Flambeau, which he cauſed to paſs by on purpoſe, he diſcryed it was <hi>Chabannes.</hi> It is not eaſie to determine which of the two was in the greateſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; the Prince ſtarted back two ſteps, and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bannes</hi> had like to fallen into a ſwound; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that he had need of the greateſt preſence of Spirit to bring himſelf off out of that dangerous condition, he recollected himſelf, and Silence, dear Sir, ſaid he ſoftly to the Dauphin, let me alone with my Stratagem, I have begun, and do thus, purſue it for your intereſt, let me proceed, and I will tell you the whole Myſtery when we have more leiſure. <hi>Chabannes</hi> thought to have qualified the Princes heat by that Propoſition; and ſuppoſing the time too ſhort for ſo ſpecious an invention, he thought to gain more to make it more plauſible: But the Prince was not to be wheedled at that rate, he had naturally an aptitude to be jealous. It was not many moments before that <hi>Chabannes</hi> had left him, and no mention of his deſign, beſides his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure at firſt betrayed him. The Princes Eyes opened both in an inſtant, he was highly tranſported; but the deſire of Revenge follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe upon his ſuſpicion of the Treaſon, he reſtrained himſelf, and pretended to be caught in that ſnare which <hi>Chabannes</hi> had laid. <hi>Chaban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:65131:145"/>was admitted into the Counteſſes Chamber, and perſwaded himſelf his Wits had brought him off; he gave her a relation of all that was paſt, and the good Lady was almoſt diſtracted, for ſhe could ſee no way poſſible to get out of that Labyrinth. The Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin in the mean time ran to his Fathers Chamber, he had a thouſand fancies in his head in a moment which perſwaded him <hi>Chabannes</hi> was the Traitor: I beſeech you, Sir, ſaid he to the King, will you be pleaſed to go along with me into Madam <hi>Agnes</hi>'s Chamber, and you ſhall ſee irrefragable proofs of her infidelity to you. The King had that night ſup'd in his Bed, he had been a hunting, was weary, and no body with him to entertain him but <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouille.</hi> Is it not <hi>Trimouille</hi> again, ſaid he to the Prince, pointing to him with his finger, who is in ſuch favour with the Counteſs? No, Sir, replied the Dauphin, it is not <hi>Trimouille,</hi> and I beg his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for ſuſpecting him; but vouchſafe, Sir, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to diſcover the Myſtery with your own Eyes, and you ſhall find it extraordinary: The Prince would not name <hi>Chabannes</hi> but in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; he had intruſted him with ſo many flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Secrets in his time, he was afraid of his indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and was reſolved to deſtroy him before his accuſation. His reſervedneſs in that point made the King give little credit to the reſt; he would not diſturb his Miſtreſs, he told him he was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently aſſured of her Vertue: but <hi>Trimouille</hi> who had a long time deſired to be right with the Prince, and found himſelf obliged to him for the Apology he had made, added his inſtances to the Princes, and together they prevailed upon his Majeſty to go;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65131:145"/>he called for his Night-Gown, and giving Order no body ſhould follow but the Prince and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouille,</hi> he went into a little Gallery which paſt betwixt his Lodgings and the Counteſſes. The two Lovers had been ſo long in conſultation about the Courſe they were to ſteer, that the debate was not ended, when <hi>Mortaing</hi> (who was all the while upon the Guard) came in running with the New that the King was at hand. The Counteſs was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſurpriſed at the Alarm; but being reſolved (let what would happen) <hi>Chabannes</hi> ſhould not be found diſguiſed in her Chamber, ſhe cauſed him to ſtep in betwixt the Papers, and the glaſs of the Window, and <hi>Mortaing</hi> having put to the Shuts, and drawn the Curtains, the King found the Counteſs without any Company, but a few Books which ſhe pretended to be reading with great intention. What have you done, Madam, ſaid the Prince to her with ſomething an angry Tone, with the man that brought you theſe Books? Have you occaſion for him, Sir, replied the Counteſs with a ſmile as quiet and unconcerned, as it had been natural? Yes, Madam, replied the Prince, I have occaſion for him, and it is for him the King comes hither to ſearch; you muſt command him to be called then, Sir, ſaid ſhe to the Prince, it is not long ſince he was here, and he cannot be gone far. The Prince had placed his Sentinels at all paſſages to the Counteſſes Appartment, he ſent to inquire of them, if any ſuch perſon had gone by, and they aſſured him not. We ſhall not go far then ſure, ſaid the Prince, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Candle in his own hand, to find out what we look for, the Bird is not yet out of its Neſt; and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:65131:146"/>then ſearching in all the corners of the Chamber, he put the poor Counteſs into a miſerable fright; but perceiving he did not think of looking where he ought, ſhe recollected her ſelf, and taking the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of her good Fortune; See, Sir, ſaid ſhe to the King, the effects of that hatred <hi>Monſieur Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> has always had for me, which I could never overcome: It is not many days ſince he ſuſpected me for <hi>Tremouille,</hi> now he would charge me with another, and I do expect ſome time or other he will foiſt ſome body into my Chamber, on purpoſe he may be found there. Shall I be any longer expoſed to theſe dangers, Sir? ſaid ſhe to the King, ſuffer me I beſeech you to retire (and with that word ſhe burſt out into tears) I conjure you ſuffer me, by all the bounty wherewith your Majeſty has honoured me: I am not able any longer to hold out againſt the Power and Malevolence of the Prince; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect him as much as he hates me, and a thouſand deaths I would endure before I would divert your kindneſs from him; ſuffer me therefore, for God ſake ſuffer me to retire. No, Madam, replied the King (toucht to the very heart to ſee his Miſtreſſes tears) you ſhall not retire, my Son ſhall learn to pay better reſpect to what is ſo dear to me; and thereupon he commanded him out of his ſight, and to appear no more before him till he was ſent for. The Dauphin thought that Command very unjuſt, and the Hiſtory tells that he diſpenſed with many things which were inconſiſtent with the reſpect he ought to his Father; but <hi>Tremouille</hi> pacified the diſorder, and prevailed with the Prince to go out of the Chamber. To comfort the Counteſs after ſo
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:65131:146"/>many croſſes, the King told her he would take up his Quarters with her that night. She uſed all the Arguments ſhe could to moderate that exceſs of Commiſeration; ſhe pretended ſhe had cryed till her head aked, and the injuries ſhe had received had put her into a very ill capacity of that Honour: But the King admitting no excuſes, there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity ſhe muſt obey, and <hi>Chabannes</hi> continued all that cold night in the Window, whilſt the King was luxuriating in the Arms of his Miſtreſs. I leave the Reader to judge how the poor Stationer entertained himſelf; he durſt neither breathe, nor ſtir, and the leaſt ſneeze in the world might have coſt him his life. The compaſſionate Counteſs did what ſhe could to ſhorten his pain: ſhe counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf ill ſo cunningly, the King left her very early in the morning. As ſoon as he was gone, <hi>Mortaing</hi> came to take her Count out of the Preſs, where he had paſt away his time ſo ſadly betwixt apprehenſion and cold, that he was in appearance more than half dead.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>But there's no cold ſo rigid to the ſenſe,</l>
                  <l>But yields to th' ardour of Loves influence.</l>

               </q>
               <p>When the Count was ſufficiently chafft, and come to himſelf, it was agreed betwixt them that he ſhould pretend to the Dauphin, that having
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:65131:147"/>found a Letter which appointed a <hi>Rendez-vous</hi> in Madam <hi>Agnes</hi>'s Lodgings, to a certain perſon who was to be admitted in the Habit of a Citizen car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his Books; he had taken that Diſguiſe upon him to diſcover the Intrigue: but that he found it was nothing but from one of her Women to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and therefore he went back again without further attempt, when he perceived it was a Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſo inferiour Contrivance. <hi>Chabannes</hi> had but little hopes the Dauphin would ſwallow this ſtory; but he was to make the beſt of a bad Market, and if the worſt came to the worſt, it was but loſing his friendſhip: The greateſt difficulty remaining was, which way to make his retreat without being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for they doubted not but Scouts were laid at all paſſages about her Houſe. <hi>Mortaing</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred her ſelf of a certain <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſtature, who was one of Madam <hi>Agnes</hi>'s Laundry-Maids, ſhe went up, and fetcht down one of her Gowns, pretending to ſee the faſhion of it: She put it upon <hi>Chabannes</hi> as well as ſhe could; and giving him a kind of a Hood they wore in thoſe days, which covered half their bodies, ſhe paſt him through the Wardrobe, as if it had been ſhe whom he did repreſent. The Spies having Orders to ſtop no body but ſuch a one as was deſcribed to them, they examined not the Laundry-Maid, but let her paſs out of the Palace without any obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but as he was marching to a Houſe in the Town where S. <hi>Colombe</hi> managed his Diſguiſes, <hi>Chabannes</hi> was perceived by a perſon, who having a while conſidered his motion and his habit, cryed out on a ſudden, Ah marry! this is he I look for.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:65131:147"/>Upon which Alarm two or three armed men that were by, threw themſelves upon the Count, who was then in no poſture to defend himſelf; they ſeized upon him, clapt him into a Boat upon the <hi>Loire,</hi> and commanded the Water-man to paſs over to the other ſide as faſt as he could. Our Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in Maſcarade knew not whether he was arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>Chabannes,</hi> or as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman, and not daring to tell them who he was, left they ſhould take him for who he was not, he would not turn up his Hood. One of Madam <hi>Agnes</hi>'s Servants having ſeen this Attachment, and knowing the Laundreſſes Gown very well, ſhe came thundring with the News to the Counteſſes Appartment. The ſtory ſeemed falſe to the Family, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman was at that time in the Wardrobe; but Madam <hi>Agnes</hi> imagining the worſt, believed it was the Dauphin had cauſed him to be apprehended. She doubted not but the whole Intrigue was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and not being able to out-face the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the King, ſhe got into her Coach, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied only by <hi>Mortaing,</hi> and without more ado betook her ſelf to a Monaſtery. The King hearing of her Retirement, concluded it the effect of the laſt nights perquiſition, and fell into a moſt outragious paſſion againſt the Prince. The Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin proteſted he was in the right, and not guilty of any thing that was falſe; but it was in vain, the more he laboured to juſtifie himſelf, the more he exaſperated his Father. His Friends adviſed him to withdraw till the ſtorm was over, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he retired into the Province of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> as ſome ſay much better ſatisfied with <hi>Trimouille</hi> than
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65131:148"/>they could have imagined. <hi>Chabannes</hi> in the mean time returned peeceably to his own Houſe; the man that had run away with him, was the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Womans Husband, in whoſe Cloaths the Count was eſcapt: This Woman had run away from her good man upon pretence of ill uſage; and he being not at all conſenting to the Divorce, and not daring to offer any violence to the Sanctuary ſhe had choſen, he watcht her perpetually in the ſtreets, reſolved to ſecure her whenever he met her, as he thought he had done in the perſon of <hi>Chabannes.</hi> When by the reproaches he made him, the Count perceived his miſtake, he pulled up his Hood, and the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undeceived, he beg'd his pardon, and recondu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him to the Citizens houſe, whither he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before when he ſtopt him. <hi>Chabannes</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Cloaths, and came immediately to Court to ſee how things paſt. He was exceedingly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to underſtand their proceedings, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht S. <hi>Colombe</hi> to Madam <hi>Agnes</hi> in Poſt-haſte: he prevailed upon her more by that one Meſſage, than the King had done with all his importunities: She took her leave of her Covent, and returned to Court illuſtrious, and more pleaſant than ever: But ſhe enjoyed not long the advantages of her reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for ſhe dyed not many days after. The cauſes of her death were found to be unnatural, and <hi>Monſieur Tremouille</hi>'s ſudden Retreat to the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin at the ſame time, made it too probable he was inſtrumental in the buſineſs. The good King <hi>Charles</hi> was ſo paſſionately afflicted therewith, he would admit of no conſolation: <hi>Chabannes</hi> had like to have dyed with ſorrow, but the Kings favour
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:65131:148"/>ſupported him. He had <hi>Tremouilles</hi> place (vacant by his abſenting himſelf) confer'd upon him by the King, during whoſe life he quickly enjoyed it. It is not to be imagined he was in ſuch favour when the Prince came to the Crown; he was arreſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could eſcape, and the Dauphin being now <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. would have ſacrificed him to his new Dignity, had not he evaded his indignation by eſcaping out of the <hi>Baſtille.</hi> I refer the Reader to the Hiſtory it ſelf to be informed of all the Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. The Annals of Love obſerve only the more remarkable Paſſages, and repreſents them without any regular Order.</p>

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:65131:149"/>conſtrained to marry her. He had one Daughter by her, which he called <hi>Feliciane,</hi> after the name of her Mother. The Mother and the Daughter begat a kindneſs in him to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation: He ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his Wife to teach his Daughter that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as her Mother-tongue; and when any <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> of Quality came into <hi>Barbary,</hi> he lodged them uſually at his own Houſe, and performed all the good offices to them he was able. <hi>Alphonſo Ribie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> Son to <hi>Don Garcias Ribiero,</hi> born in <hi>Alcantara,</hi> came to <hi>Tunis,</hi> to treat about the Ranſom of his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother, who ſailing into <hi>Greece,</hi> was taken by the Pirats, and exchanged with certain Slaves of <hi>Barbary. Alphonſo</hi> was too young to be intruſted alone with ſo great a Negotiation; he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed only to the Ceremonial part; for there was an old Servant of his Fathers ſent along with him to manage the Bargain. He was received by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Feliciane,</hi> not only as a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but as a perſon particularly related to his Wife: She had been at his birth, and paſſed the prime of her years in <hi>Don Garcias</hi> Houſe. The young <hi>Feliciana</hi> and he were preſently ſurpriſed with a violent inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one for the other; Nature had, it ſeems, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf to prepare ways for their affection. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi> reſembled the young <hi>African</hi> ſo exactly, and the <hi>African Alphonſo,</hi> that they might well have been miſtaken, had not their Habits diſtinguiſht both their Sexes and Perſons.</p>

                  <hi>Feliciana</hi> ſeeing her own Picture in <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> as he did in <hi>Feliciana,</hi> ſhe fell in Love almoſt at firſt ſight; their looks, their manners, their motions, every thing in them prevented the office of their Tongue: ſo that they were immediately advanced to their reciprocal promiſes. Simpathy is a great promoter of ſuch Adventures, and makes a great deal of ground in a little time. Great was the joy for their Love: he performed his Honorary part very well, he was the Prieſt and the Deity both; But the liberty of his elder Brother was an unſeaſonable impediment to the Myſtery. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> uſed all the Arts he could invent not to return into <hi>Caſtille;</hi> there was not a Curioſity a man of his age could be capable of pretending, but he made uſe of to ſtay; but his Brother was inexorable, and he muſt go along: yet this was not without ſolemn promiſes from <hi>Alphonſo</hi> to come back again in a ſhort time, if he lived, and as fincere aſſurances from <hi>Feliciana,</hi> never to falſifie that faith which ſhe had given him. Their Adieu was ſorrowful and kind: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Love was at that time in ſeaſon (for Love has its ſeaſons as well as other things, and is as trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom to thoſe whoſe deſires are ſatisfied, as it is agreeable where they are in their ſpring) <hi>Alphonſo</hi> being departed, and <hi>Feliciana</hi> very impatient of his return, many months paſſed, and no News of her <hi>Caſtillan.</hi> There were ſeveral <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:65131:150"/>upon the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and in them ſome <hi>Alcantara</hi> Merchants, with Preſents from <hi>Don Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi> for <hi>Feliciana</hi>'s Mother; but no Letter, nor no private Meſſage for her. This negligence ſtartled her, ſhe was afraid ſhe was betrayed, and the firſt effect of that opinion being a reſolution to reproach the crime to the Criminal himſelf, ſhe inſinuated with a Maſter of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> and perſwading him ſhe would go over into <hi>Spain</hi> to turn Chriſtian, ſhe made him promiſe her to land her in the Port of <hi>Carthagena.</hi> The bargain made, and the hour of her Embarkment arrived, <hi>Feliciana</hi> put on a Suit of Cloaths of <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s, which he had left by accident behind him, and providing her ſelf with certain Chains of Gold, away ſhe went to meet with her <hi>Biſcayen.</hi> The Seas and the Winds were ſo favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to her deſigns, that ſhe landed at <hi>Carthagena</hi> without any accident: ſhe brought a Horſe there immediately, and taking a Guide, put herſelf upon the Road for <hi>Alcantara.</hi> She inquired of <hi>Alphonſo</hi> where-ever ſhe came; in ſome place they knew not where he was, in others they knew him not at all; but at length there was an old Hoſteſs of <hi>Toledo</hi> who told our diſguiſed <hi>African</hi> there was to be a Meeting of all the <hi>Ribieros</hi> in that Town within a few days, that ſhe underſtood ſo much from a Neighbour of hers, at whoſe Houſe that Family uſed to lodge; and that the ſame Neighbour told her withal, that <hi>Don Garcias</hi> came to be preſent at the Marriage of his younger Son with one <hi>Hypolita de Cueva,</hi> which was reckoned the handſomeſt young Maid in <hi>Caſtille.</hi> This News ſtruck <hi>Feliciana</hi> to the heart, ſhe wondred not now her Lover had been
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:65131:151"/>ſo lazy as never to write to her; ſhe found he had other affairs upon his hands: ſhe reſolved how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to attend him at <hi>Toledo,</hi> and cauſing her ſelf to be called <hi>Felician,</hi> her ſhape and her legs concurred ſo well with her deſign, ſhe was not ſuſpected in the leaſt. She was handſom, and the Sex ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to in her Diſguiſe, made her Beauty more rare. She never ſtir'd out of her Inn but the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome Complement or other: One Evening as ſhe was walking in one of the Walks in <hi>Toledo,</hi> and according to her old cuſtom had been interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted by ſeveral idle Propoſitions, a certain Lady in a Vail came to her, pulled her privately by the Arm, and made ſigns to her to follow her: <hi>Feliciana,</hi> or <hi>Felician,</hi> as you pleaſe, thought this alſo was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of his Miſtreſſes, whoſe hopes ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to betray; and in that opinion would have ſteered her courſe another way, but the Lady laying hold on her; Follow me, thou perfidious <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> ſaid ſhe to her, follow me, or I'le be thy deſtruction. The Name of <hi>Alphonſo</hi> awakening the Curioſity of <hi>Feliciane,</hi> ſhe followed the Lady into a Chamber where there were ſeveral Candles lighted. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady as ſoon as ſhe was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, turned up her Vail, and diſcovering a ſingular Beauty; Whence is it, <hi>Alphonſe,</hi> ſaid ſhe to her, that you conſtrain me to theſe Stratagems to gain a little of your Converſe? what reaſon have you to change your Name, and call your ſelf <hi>Felician?</hi> why do you conceal your ſelf from <hi>Hypolita de Cue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va?</hi> in ſhort, what is this Myſtery, and what grounds have you for it? <hi>Feliciane</hi> perceived by her diſcourſe it was her Rival whom Fortune had
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65131:151"/>delivered into her hands, and being firmly reſolved to give her no quarter; This Myſtery is greater than I can tell you, Madam, replied ſhe, I would ſpare my ſelf the hardſhip of telling you my ſelf, and that is the true reaſon I have declined you for ſome days: But, Madam, ſince you will force me, I muſt needs confeſs I am not capable of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing our Marriage. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> Journey to <hi>Toledo</hi> will be in vain, for the faith you expect ſo impatiently from me, is, alas, ingaged to another a long while ago. How! cryed <hi>Hypolita</hi> in a mighty ſurpriſe, your faith ingaged to another? Yes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, continued <hi>Felician,</hi> an <hi>African</hi> Lady, inferior to your ſelf neither in Birth nor in Love, and (to one that was in Love with her) not much behind you in Beauty, has received that faith which you challenge. Ha! why then, thou perjured Perſon, replied <hi>Hypolita,</hi> haſt thou been ſo audacious as to promiſe me? I am a man, replied <hi>Feliciana,</hi> and he that names Man, names Unconſtancy; your Beauty made me forget for a while what I ought to my <hi>African;</hi> but I am returned to my firſt Love, and ſince I muſt be free with you, let me tell you I will dye a thouſand deaths before I will betray her: Ha! Traitor, cryed the diſconſolate <hi>Hypolita,</hi> I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pierced into your heart through all your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes, I obſerved always a force upon your actions, which me-thought, gave your Language the lye; and you know, vile man, I have told you ſo often. But, ſaid ſhe purſuing her tranſport, you ſhall never boaſt you have captivated <hi>Hypolita,</hi> unpaniſht, what my kindneſs cannot expect, my vengeance muſt obtain: And then calling up people to ſeize

The old <hi>Caſtillan</hi> applauded the indignation of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; he commanded <hi>Feliciana</hi> ſhould be kept ſafe that night, and the next day he ſent her to Priſon. A Magiſtrate of no ſmall Authority in that Town, was deſired to examine her: She began to relent, would have changed her ſtory, and pretended ſhe was miſtaken for another; but <hi>Hypolita</hi>'s allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the teſtimony of ſeveral other perſons which aſſured him it was <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> prevailed ſo far above all that ſhe could ſay, that ſhe was almoſt brought to the miſerable Election of marrying <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polita,</hi> or loſing her head. She had rather have dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than have cured the Jealouſie ſhe had created in her Rival; but conſidering that what ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to do her ſelf, <hi>Alphonſo</hi> would do of courſe; ſhe writ <hi>Hypolita</hi> word, that ſhe was ſo far from being <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> ſhe was the <hi>African</hi> Lady ſhe had told her of, and that if ſhe would take the pains to come to the Priſon, the ſhould ſatisfie her own eyes with the truth of it. This Letter was delivered to the Keeper, and he deſired to ſee it conveyed to <hi>Hypolita.</hi> He received it without any difficulty, lookt upon it as a Recantation, and knew the whole Family of the <hi>Cuevas</hi> deſired nothing more than that <hi>Alphonſo</hi> would do as he was obliged, without further compulſion. But by accident the Count <hi>de Atrevalo,</hi> Confident to this <hi>Alphonſo</hi> of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> and one who diſputed the Crown with King <hi>Henry,</hi> made his Entry that day into <hi>Toledo,</hi> as Covernour of the Town. The Keeper muſt needs be a Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:65131:152"/>of this Ceremony, and ingaging himſelf too far in the Crowd, he loſt his Letter. It was taken up by one of the Counts Officers, who finding the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents a little odd and unuſual, would needs ſhew it his Maſter. The Governour was as much ſurpriſed with the Adventure as his Man, and had a great Curioſity to underſtand the Particulars. He ſent word to old <hi>Seigneur Cueva,</hi> he deſired to know the difference betwixt him and <hi>Alphonſo Ribiero;</hi> and upon that pretence ſending for the Priſoner, he told her what he knew of her affairs already, and deſired her to inform him of the reſt. She ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Curioſity; ſhe was reſolved to oppoſe the Marriage betwixt <hi>Alphonſo</hi> and <hi>Hypolita,</hi> and ſhe believed it ſo near a concluſion, that ſhe thought ſhe ought not to make a Secret any longer of that which the whole World would know in a very ſhort time. But it fell out otherwiſe however. The Count <hi>de Atrevano,</hi> who by the ntural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity of his Nation, was inclinable to impreſſions of love, took a great liking to the <hi>African;</hi> he thought he ſhould do great Service to the Families both of the <hi>Cuevas</hi> and <hi>Ribieros,</hi> to keep this Lady out of their ſight, and fancying great pleaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in having ſo fair a Miſtreſs in his Chamber, without any Parents or Relations to call him to an account; he cauſed <hi>Feliciana</hi> to be removed to a Caſtle a few days Journey from <hi>Toledo.</hi> The carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her away made a ſtrange noiſe in the Town <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Hypolita</hi>'s Friends believed <hi>Don Garcias</hi> had cauſed it. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> on the contrary, who expected to find <hi>Alphonſo</hi> in good Intelligence with <hi>Hypolita,</hi> and was come thither to ſee her married, was much
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:65131:153"/>ſurpriſed to hear News ſo contrary to his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he demanded his Son of <hi>Seigneur Cueva,</hi> and old <hi>Cueva</hi> demanded him of him: To explain the Intrigue, the Governour attended for <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> but <hi>Alphonſo</hi> did not appear; conſidering therefore that he could not declare what he knew, without diſcovering what he had a mind to conceal, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſay nothing, and therefore leaving the Parents to diſpute it among themſelves, he went himſelf to the Caſtle, whither he had cauſed <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciana</hi> to be conducted. He had ordered her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Cloaths, and Women to attend her, and the Count found her as handſom a Lady as he had been a Cavalier. He acquainted her with his intentions, and telling her it was unreaſonable ſo excellent a Perſon ſhould be ſerved only by a Lover that had been falſe, he offered himſelf to repair the injury ſhe had received from young <hi>Alphonſo. Feliciana</hi> trembled at his tydings, but returned him this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That ſhe gave him many thanks for the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility of his Offer; but being come into <hi>Spain</hi> only in queſt of her <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> ſhe beg'd of him the liberty to purſue her deſign. The Governour would not openly contend with her obſtinacy, he had a mind to be happy with as little trouble as he could. He made ſeveral rich Preſents to the <hi>African,</hi> and ſhe accepted them with ſcorn, he ſhewed her the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the Caſtle, and ſhe ſeemed not to regard them; he reſolved to have a little patience, and ſee how that would work: and therefore returned to his new Government, and leaving one of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews, called <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> in Command he gave him expreſs charge to have a care of her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:65131:153"/>and ſo to prepare her with his Counſels, that he might find her tractable at his Return. He put his affairs into ſafe hands to ſucceed. <hi>Don Fernand</hi> had been no leſs ſmitten with the ſight of <hi>Feliciana,</hi> than his Uncle the Count: When he found himſelf Maſter of his Deſtiny, he began to pay her ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects as were not at all compatible with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, he ſighed, he raved, flew out ſo far as to make ridiculous Pictures of his Uncle, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees fell into expreſſions to this purpoſe, that if he were in Love with <hi>Feliciana,</hi> his thoughts were more innocent than his; it was not long before he blurted quite out, and told the <hi>African</hi> the whole bottom of his heart. All Lovers in the World but <hi>Alphonſo</hi> were indifferent to her, the legitimacy of <hi>Fernandos</hi> deſires were no advantage to him at all, and ſhe had no more inclination to be married to him, than to be Miſtreſs to his Uncle; but judging very prudently notwithſtanding, that by oppoſing one of them againſt the other, ſhe might ſecure her ſelf againſt both, ſhe pretended to hearken to <hi>Don Fernands</hi> Propoſitions, and let fall ſome triſling Complacences on purpoſe. A witty Woman is at no great expence to pleaſe a man that is in Love with her. <hi>Fernand</hi> was extremely well ſatisfied with his good Fortune; <hi>Feliciana</hi> prevailed with him to let her eſcape, but upon promiſe to ſtay for him upon the Frontiers of <hi>Arragon,</hi> where in a few days he ingaged to wait upon her, and conduct her into <hi>France.</hi> He had a great mind to have gone away with her from the firſt, but ſhe perſwaded it would be more convenient for him to ſtay with the Count, and to facilitate her Eſcape, by perverting
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:65131:154"/>the Hue and Crys, and ſending them the wrong way. The Project being laid with all poſſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, and all things prepared that were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for its execution, <hi>Feliciana</hi> reſumed the Habit of her Cavalier, mounted upon a Horſe <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> had given her, and deluding the vigilance of her Women, ſtole away one morning from her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Impriſonment, to ſeek out a refuge for the innocence of her Love. <hi>Don Fernand</hi> faſtned a Cord to her Bed-Chamber Window, that it might be preſumed ſhe had eſcapt that way; he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be infinitely concerned for her eſcape; and for his better diſſimulation, he put himſelf in purſuit of her, as if he had had an unſatiable deſire to have recovered her. He was but juſt gone out, when <hi>Alphouſo</hi> came to repoſe himſelf an hour or two in the Caſtle. He had his reaſons not to venture him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Towns, and knowing the Magnificence of the Count <hi>d' Atrevalo,</hi> he doubted not but a Stranger of his Garb would be well received in any place belonging to him; nor was he deceived: They entertained him very civilly, appointed him to eat, and <hi>Feliciana</hi>'s Appartment being open, and lying moſt conveniently, the Steward attended the new Gueſt into her Champber. There was a Picture of <hi>Feliciana</hi>'s hung up in the Room, exceedingly like her, which <hi>Don Fernand</hi> had beg'd of her one time when his Uncle had ſent Painters to adorn a Gallery in the Caſtle. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> was ſurpriſed at the ſight of that Picture, as is eaſily to be imagined. <hi>Feliciana</hi> was dreſt in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mode, and that Dreſs diſguiſed her a little; but however ſhe was diſcernable to Eyes leſs penetrating than a Lovers.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:65131:154"/>He was going out to inquire of ſome body whoſe that Picture was, and how it came thither; but in his perplexities he took one door for another, and inſtead of going into the Antichamber, which led to the ſtairs, he found himſelf in a little Cloſet adorned with Pictures, whoſe Frames of Wainſcot were all covered over with Love-knots, wounded Hearts, and double FF. theſe fancies augmented his aſtoniſhment; and to carry it on to the higheſt degree, he found a little Table-book lying open up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Table, and written as he conceived with <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciana</hi>'s own hand: he took it up, and read theſe Verſes enſuing.</p>

                  <p>This Title promiſed ſome rare and divertiſing Articles; but <hi>Feliciana</hi> had not had time to write them, and if ſhe had, <hi>Alphonſo</hi> was in ſuch trouble, he could not have had the power to have read them. He went down the firſt ſtairs he could meet with,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:65131:155"/>which ſtairs went directly to her Maids Chamber, where by accident having taken Phyſick that day, the Governeſs was in Bed. She was an old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man truckling under the burden of her age, and yet ſeeing but a man come into the Room, ſhe skreekt out, and hid her face under the Coverlet, as if ſhe had been but fifteen, and her vertue in the greateſt danger imaginable. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> excuſed himſelf, told her he was a Stranger, who knew not whither the ſtairs would carry him, beg'd her pardon for ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing her in that condition, and deſired her to inform him, if ſhe could, where the Count <hi>d' Atre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valo</hi> had got the Picture which hung in a Chamber hard by. Is it <hi>Feliciana</hi>'s Picture you mean? ſaid the old Woman, with her head in the Bed all the while. Yes, replied <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> 'tis ſhe I ſpeak of. <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> that Governours Nephew, replied the old Woman, cauſed it to be drawn by the life. And where is that Lady? cryed <hi>Alphonſo</hi> in haſte. The Governeſs was much offended with <hi>Feliciana</hi>'s eſcape: ſhe found her imployment very good, could not pardon the <hi>African</hi> for making it ceaſe, and the diſguſts of ſuch kind of perſons go ſeldom without a touch of ill language. She is rambling about the World, ſaid the malicious old Woman; ſhe was two months together in this Houſe, where the Cont <hi>d' Atrevalo</hi> cauſed her to be treated, as ſhe had been the beſt Lady in <hi>Caſtille;</hi> but not being willing to be reſtrained, and, as it ſeems not accuſtomed to be contented with one Servant, ſhe got away this very night out of her Chamber Window by the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a Bed-cord. I am damned, if jealous <hi>Don Fernand</hi> had not a hand in it: I obſerved kibg ſince
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:65131:155"/>there was a kindneſs betwixt them; and when ſhe ſate for her Picture, I durſt have ſworn by their gloating, the poor Count would be betrayed. The old Matron had ſcarce finiſht theſe words, but two or three of her other Women hearing a noiſe from the next Chamber where they were, came in to ſee what was the matter. They no ſooner caſt their eyes upon <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> but they took him for <hi>Feliciana;</hi> one could not forbear expreſſing her joy to ſee her returned; another upbraided her by the fright into which ſhe had been put. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> perceived their miſtake, and told them they took him for another perſon; but they obſerving him to be preparing to be gone, and not being able to believe but this was <hi>Feliciana,</hi> they threw themſelves upon him cryed out for more help; and in ſhort, ſeized upon him in ſpight of all his proteſtations, that he was none of <hi>Feliciana.</hi> Whilſt theſe things were in tranſaction, the Count <hi>d' Atrevalo</hi> arrived; he had been told of <hi>Feliciana</hi>'s eſcape by the firſt he met, and underſtanding afterwards what had paſſed in the Governeſſes Chamber, he repaired thither with all ſpeed to ſee what was the matter. Which way have I diſobliged you, <hi>Feliciana,</hi> ſaid he to <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> whom he took at firſt for his <hi>African,</hi> what have I done that ſhould cauſe you to diſguiſe your ſelf to eſcape from me? I love you, I confeſs, <hi>Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> but I appeal to your ſelf whether that paſſion had ever any effects that might conſtrain you to this Metamorphoſis. Submiſſive Repreſentations have hitherto been to only Interpreters of my Heart: I have not left you any thing to ſuſpect me of that was unworthy, I have required nothing of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:65131:156"/>you but what was lawful; I have kept you two months together in my Houſe, without abuſing my power, and you have reſtrained my affections t the ſevere bounds of Civility: why then, <hi>Feliciana,</hi> do you flye from me? or what one thing have I done to diſoblige you? Had it not been for the Conference he had had with the old Governeſs, this Diſcourſe coming out of the Rivals own mouth would have amply reſolved his ſuſpicions; but it was not now, the Count he was jealous of ſo much as <hi>Don Fernand.</hi> I am not ſhe you take me for, Sir, ſaid he to the Count; I know my reſemblance is great enough to authorize your miſtake; but though Nature hath created that reſemblance in our faces, Heaven hath formed our mind of different Conſtitutions; hers is as diſloyal as mine is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the perjury of which ſhe is guilty, betrays me with as much ingratitude, as I am charged with for not betraying of her. The Count having had leiſure whilſt <hi>Alphonſo</hi> was ſpeaking, to examine him more ſtrictly, diſcerned ſome difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him, and his <hi>African.</hi> His ſtature was the larger of the two, his Features more remarkable, and he perceived ſome glimmerings of a beard, he began to think it muſt be <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> and therefore looking upon him now rather as his Rival than his Miſtreſs; he cauſed him to be ſhut up cloſe, ſent to give notice to old <hi>Cueva</hi> of his detention, and ſwore he would dye but he would make young <hi>Ribiero</hi> marry <hi>Hypolita.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Feliciana</hi> was making her eſcape, not knowing whither ſhe was going, nor in what place ſhe could find any prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. She durſt not continue in <hi>Caſtille,</hi> ſhe
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:65131:156"/>could not reſolve to go back into <hi>Barbary,</hi> much leſs would ſhe go to the place where ſhe had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Don Fernand</hi> to meet her. She took the right hand way, where ſhe had promiſed to take the left, and the left where ſhe was to have taken the right; and being equally fearful of loſing, and not loſing her way, ſhe marcht on in a moſt unutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perplexity. It is not to be queſtioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe made uſe of any imprecations againſt the ingrateful perſon, had run her upon theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whether ſhe reſolved to hate his perſon as much as ſhe deteſted his infidelity, and whether in repenting ſhe had loved him, ſhe did not reſolve to love him no longer; all theſe confuſions were the common effects of jealouſie and anger, and never was Lover in <hi>Feliciana</hi>'s condition but was ſenſible of them. Being in the higheſt of theſe ſorrowful reflections, and entred into a Wood ſhe knew not which was the way out of; ſhe was in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of paſſing not only the reſt of the day, but the whole night in that ſolitude, when by accident ſhe met with a Cavaliere, who having lookt wiſhly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her once or twice, made up to her with deſign to accoſt her. The poor <hi>Feliciana</hi> was ſo prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt with fear, that forgetting her Diſguiſe, ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended this Gallant would prove ſome new <hi>Amouroſo,</hi> and clapt Spurs to her Horſe to eſcape him, if ſhe could: But the Cavalier crying out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her, Hold, <hi>Seigneur Alphouſo,</hi> 'tis your moſt faithful <hi>Mandoce,</hi> ſhe recollected her ſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo curious as to look back. She reſolved to make advantage of this accident, and replied, I did not know you indeed as I was paſſing, but well,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:65131:157"/>how does the fair <hi>Hypolita? Hypolita,</hi> Sir, ſaid <hi>Mandoce,</hi> would not receive your Letter; ſhe told me you were a Traitor, and that ſhe abhorred your very Name, that ſhe would not proſecute your death, that ſhe was ſo generous as to rejoyce that you were ſafe; but that you ſhould not preſume for the future to abuſe her integrity, unleſs you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to provoke her fury again. I intreated her to explain her Diſcourſe, and aſſured her I knew nothing of it; but my ignorance was taken for an artifice, and ſhe threatned to have me appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and your retreat, and the place I was to meet you, extorted from me by torments. I had no directions to inform her, and me-though ſhe lookt as if ſhe would have been as good as her word: Her threatning me ſo, made me get out of <hi>Toledo</hi> as faſt as I could, and my advice is, that you would get as far off as you can alſo; for knowing how things ſtand in your own conſcience, my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Sir, is it will be no place for you. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given his Judgment, <hi>Mandoce</hi> ſuppoſing <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciana</hi> to be his Maſter, put the Letter into her hands. <hi>Feliciana</hi> took it, and ſtepping two or three paces aſide, that <hi>Mandoce</hi> might not perceive the trouble it gave her, ſhe opened it, and read as follows.</p>

The Count <hi>d'Atrevalo</hi> having News that the Count <hi>de Benevent</hi> (a great Lord in <hi>Caſtille</hi>) and ſome other of his beſt friends were coming to his Houſe, and apprehending that <hi>Alphonſo</hi> might take advantage to eſcape by the diſorder ſo much company was like to produce; and being abſolutely reſolved to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the poſſeſſion of <hi>Feliciana,</hi> by forcing his Rival to marry <hi>Hypolita,</hi> he cauſed him to be conveyed to a Fort upon the Frontier of <hi>Murcia,</hi> not above a days Journey from thence. The Priſoner went away late from the Counts Houſe, and could not reach his Giſte; he was forced to lye by the way, and it fell out his Quarters were taken up for him in the ſame place where he had appointed <hi>Mandoce</hi> to come to him: The ſame Fortune contrived it, that <hi>Don Fernand</hi> returning from the ſearch he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, was come to the ſame Houſe. <hi>Feliciana</hi> ſaw him come into the Court, through the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of her Chamber, and the very ſight of him had like to have made her betake her ſelf to her heels; but a new fancy coming into her head in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, ſhe ſent <hi>Mandoce</hi> to let him know <hi>Feliciana</hi>
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:65131:159"/>would ſpeak with him, and ordered one of <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi>'s Servants to conduct him into a little Court into which ſhe had obſerved one of her Windows did look. <hi>Mandoce</hi> diſcharged himſelf of his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and <hi>Don Fernand</hi> came overjoy'd to the Window where <hi>Feliciana</hi> expected him: My dear <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, and as ſoftly as ſhe could ſpeak, Heaven has ſent you once more to my relief; I am taken again, 'tis I that am conducting to the Frontiers of <hi>Murcia,</hi> the Count <hi>d'Atrevalo</hi> takes me for <hi>Alphonſo;</hi> but do not you ſuffer your ſelf to be deceived with our reſemblance; I am <hi>Feliciana,</hi> and to convince you, See there, ſaid ſhe, throwing her Table-book to him, ſee what you gave me when I took my leave of you at the Counts Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, you ſhall find there the Roads you directed me to take, and ſet them down with your own hand, ſave me once more, if you can poſſibly. After this Propoſition ſhe pulled in her head, and retired, as ſhe had been afraid to be over-heard; and <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> returning as faſt, he fell upon contriving which way he ſhould reſcue the Priſoner which he took to be <hi>Feliciana;</hi> he went to the Officer which commanded the Convoy, and told him the Count having occaſion to imploy him with all ſpeed at the Caſtle, had ſent him to execute his place. The Officer knowing him to be his Nephew, and in good eſteem with the Count, made no ſcruple to reſign, and mounting in the morning by break of day, away he went Poſt where <hi>Fernand</hi> directed him. His back was no ſooner turned, but <hi>Don Fernand</hi> commanded his Convoy to horſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed them, ſome he placed in one poſt, ſome in
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:65131:159"/>another, ſome he ſent to ſecure ſuch a Paſs, others to poſſeſs ſuch a Bridge, and when they were far enough aſunder, running to <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s Bed, Come let us ſave our ſelves now, <hi>Feliciana,</hi> ſaid he, all things are ready for our eſcape: We will go to <hi>Carthagena,</hi> which is no great diſtance from hence, and from thence paſs into <hi>Barbary;</hi> but you muſt make haſte, for time is precious. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood immediately who he took him for; but he had no mind to rectifie an errour was like to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him his liberty. He dreſt himſelf out of hand, and followed the Count. They took Horſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any noiſe, and marcht directly for <hi>Carthagena.</hi> The Sun was not quite up when they departed, and they paſſed upon a Cauſway that would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to diſcourſe. But as ſoon as <hi>Don Fernand</hi> found himſelf out of danger, my dear <hi>Feliciana,</hi> ſaid he to his Rival, putting one of his Arms about her Neck, ſee now, at length we are delivered from the Tyranny of the Count <hi>d'Atrevalo:</hi> he ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb our felicity no more, and thanks to the good counſel you gave, we ſhall find in <hi>Barbary</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which we durſt not ſo much as hope for in <hi>Caſtille;</hi> But tell me, my dear, how came you to be re-taken, how came you to deceive my Uncle, and by what good Fortune did you find the way of ſpeaking to me yeſterday? <hi>Alphonſo</hi> underſtood but one part of his Diſcourſe; but that was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to inform him, that he who talkt to him was his Rival, and the Counts Nephew who reſcued <hi>Feliciana</hi> from the hands of his Uncle the firſt time. This conſideration tranſported him with jealouſie and fury: he clapt his hand upon one of <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nands</hi>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:65131:160"/>Piſtols, and clapping Spurs to his Horſe to diſingage himſelf a little, he turned ſhort, and told him, thou ſhalt dye, vile man, thou ſhalt dye, and thy blood revenge the perſidiouſneſs of my ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miſtreſs. <hi>Don Fernand</hi> was ſo ſurpriſed at this action, he took it at firſt for a dream. He lookt upon himſelf, he ſtared upon <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> he knew he was <hi>Don Fernand;</hi> but he took his Rival for his Miſtreſs, and not being able to accommodate theſe inconſiſtencies, being clearly tranſported, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> if he had loſt his ſenſes, or whether he knew him or not: I know you too well, replied the young <hi>Bibiero;</hi> but it is you that does not know me: defend your ſelf while you may, or I ſhall ſpoil your fencing. <hi>Feliciana</hi> and <hi>Mandoce</hi> came in juſt as <hi>Alphonſo</hi> had ſpoke thoſe words: They had watcht when <hi>Don Fernand</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and traced him all the way; Hold, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo,</hi> cryed the <hi>African,</hi> forcing her ſelf betwixt them, do not attempt the life of a perſon, to whom you are indebted for your <hi>Feliciana.</hi> Theſe words and the ſight of <hi>Feliciana,</hi> opened <hi>Don Fernands</hi> Eyes, and he became ſenſible of his miſtake: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred he had heard talk of the reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Alphonſo</hi> and his <hi>African,</hi> and concluding it was his Rival he had delivered, he would have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon him; but <hi>Feliciana</hi> and <hi>Mandoce</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: Be patient, <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> ſaid the <hi>African</hi> to him, be patient, your fury at this time will be in vain: I do not doubt but it troubles you, that you have reſcued your Rival, inſtead of your Miſtreſs, and that it muſt be great regret to you to have twice betrayed your Uncle, when you conſider the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:65131:160"/>effects of that Treaſon were nothing elſe but the delivering up <hi>Feliciana</hi> to her <hi>Alphonſo;</hi> but there is a Deſtiny in Love, as in other things; you were not born to be more happy in yours, I am ſorry for it with all my heart, and will pray heartily to <hi>Cupid</hi> to comfort you. As for my ſelf, 'tis not in my power, I am young <hi>Ribieros,</hi> and can be no bodies elſe: And having ended her Speech, ſhe whipt on her Horſe, and <hi>Alphonſo</hi> and <hi>Mandoce</hi> followed: <hi>Alphonſo</hi> had like to have run away at the very ſight of <hi>Feliciana,</hi> ſo ſtrange an impreſſion had the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of her inconſtancy made in him: But <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doce</hi> perceiving it, got up to him, and conjured him not to be ſo fierce, for he could aſſure him his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs was innocent. What ſhe ſaid to <hi>Don Fernand</hi> confirmed his report, ſo that <hi>Alphonſo</hi> followed her much better ſatisfied than when ſhe fell firſt upon <hi>Fernand. Don Fernand</hi> endeavoured to have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their flight, at leaſt not to leave them; but the firſt was impoſſible, and as to the ſecond, the trouble which was upon him not permitting him the prudent management of his Horſe, he ran him upon a Rock before he was aware, and down he came with all four. The two Lovers did not hold it any part of their Charity to relieve him; they rid as faſt as they could to <hi>Carthagena,</hi> and from thence paſt with all ſpeed into <hi>Africk,</hi> where the ſincerity of <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s intentions, made the Father and Mother of <hi>Feliciana</hi> forget what their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had done. And all the Family of the <hi>Ribieros</hi> were glad to follow their Example. The fury of the Count <hi>d'Atrevalo</hi> was ſo great upon the News that the two Lovers were arrived ſafely in <hi>Barbary,</hi>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:65131:161"/>that not content to exerciſe his rage upon his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew (who was purſued and ſlain by his Orders) he extended it to all ſuch as had any intimacy or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Alphonſo.</hi> He perſecuted <hi>Don Garcias</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, for having taken away the beſt part of his Eſtate, and cauſed his elder Son to be executed, he forced the old man to ſeek Sanctuary with his youngeſt: and this was the Source of all the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> which in leſs than thirty years time cauſed the change of ſo many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and at length pulled down his Holineſſes Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication upon the Head of the Count <hi>d'A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trevalo;</hi> but we will leave him to his penitences, and continue our Remarks upon the moſt amorous Paſſages in Hiſtory.</p>

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:65131:161"/>that it was by his fault his Wife had no Children, and being paſſionately deſirous of them, he intreated <hi>Leonora</hi> very civilly that ſhe would contrive ſome way or other to provide him one. She pretended great horrour at the firſt Propoſition, that ſhe might have the pleaſure of being preſſed; and the King did her that kindneſs, he preſt, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, and his Election concurring with the Queens, the good Monarch conducted the Count <hi>de Cueva</hi> to the Royal Bed with his own hand.

It would be to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Laws of Nature and Gallantry, to aſcribe rigid and ſevere Vertue to a Daughter of ſo ſpurious Extraction, we muſt endeavour to repreſent her conformable to the Birth wherewith her Mother had honoured her.

                     </gap>ery, and the <hi>French</hi> are never ſo tranſcendantly illuſtrious as in foreign Countries. The <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Caſtille</hi> ſaw nothing at King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Court ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificently ſpruce as the <hi>French</hi> Count: She could
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:65131:162"/>not forbear running into an admiration of their Manners and Deportment, and the Count, like a good Polititian, perſwading <hi>Monſieur d'Alby,</hi> that to render their Embaſſie ſucceſsful, it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to gain upon the inclinations of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, in reſpect of the power ſhe had over her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and her Mother over the King; he entertained her with continual Diſcourſes about the liberty with which they made Love in <hi>France.</hi> It had not been long ſince <hi>Charles</hi> VII. was dead, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Regiment was not eſtabliſht as yet: He talkt of nothing but the wonderful free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the laſt Reign, to have heard him, one would have ſworn the good qualities of the Ladies were denominated by their Conqueſts, and he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her that in <hi>France</hi> one would paſs for either ſimple, or deformed, if at her age ſhe had not had two or three Amours. The Princeſs was jealous of the reputation of her Charms, gave the Count to underſtand ſhe liked the <hi>French</hi> faſhion very well, and according to his deſcription, would be very glad to be in it. For her firſt Leſſon, he cauſed her Picture to be taken in little, by the permiſſion of the Queen, to ſend it as he pretended, to the Count <hi>de Guyenne;</hi> but when it was finiſht, he cauſed a Copy to be taken, and ſending that to the Count, he kept the Original for himſelf; See, Madam, ſaid he to the Princeſs, how ingenious men demean themſelves in our Court; their pretences are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and fair in every thing they do. Their outward profeſſions are always above cenſure; but the ſecret intention they reſerve to themſelves; and it would be a ſign of a very barren invention to
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:65131:162"/>circumſcribe it within the bounds of a ſingle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Such ſolid Leſſons as theſe meeting with a Nature apt and diſpoſed, made ſo great a progreſs in a few months, that the Princeſs was able to have commented upon his Text. <hi>Caſtille</hi> was then in great Troubles by the pretenſions of the Infant <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo,</hi> Brother of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and the Nephew of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> who (as Hiſtorians ſay) without any lawful Right made Claim to the Crown. The Grandees of the Country endeavoured to accommodate the difference. The Marqueſs <hi>de Villena</hi> ſupporting <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s, and the Duke of <hi>Albuquerque Henry</hi>'s pretenſions. The young Princeſs had a mind to bring over the Marqueſs to the Intereſts of <hi>Henry,</hi> in which ſhe was ingaged; and to that purpoſe bethought her ſelf of putting the Count of <hi>Boulognes</hi> Documents in practice: The Marqueſs <hi>de Villena</hi> hoping to draw ſome advantage from the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Princeſs, which might be profitable to <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> prevented the obliging deſigns ſhe had upon his Heart. They began their firſt Commerce with their Eyes: if he thought he underſtood the meaning of her glances, his were no leſs intelligible to her; ſo that there needed no further explication of that Language. There was a Garden belonging to the Palace, reſerved only for the Queen and her Daughter to walk in, into which no man was ever admitted: The Princeſs took the Air there every night without any Attendance but an old Governeſs (the Count <hi>de Boulogne</hi> had corrupted) and her Maids who never came near her but when they were called. The Marqueſs found a way to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce himſelf into this Garden; he attended the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:65131:163"/>hour in which the Princeſs was accuſtomed to walk, and following her with his Eye into a Grove of Cypreſs-trees which formed themſelves into a Labyrinth, he diſcovered himſelf to her when he judged it convenient. The Princeſs was ſurpriſed to ſee a man in that place, and the firſt impreſſion made her retire: but the Marqueſs conjuring her to hear him one word, the <hi>Infanta</hi> was flexible and yielded. And for as much as the Daughters of Kings are not to be courted as common perſons are, reaſons of State being always the pretence of an ingenious Lover among them; he began firſt with a Declaration of the abſolute Power he had to negotiate in the difference betwixt <hi>Alphonſo</hi> and <hi>Henry;</hi> he next repreſented how eaſie it would be for him to propoſe in the Treaty her Marriage with <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> and obſerving the effect that Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had upon the Princeſs, he began to infinuate the Love he had for her himſelf, and declared that by her indulgence and affection, ſhe might ingage him in her Intereſts. The Princeſs took a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion worthy of the Doctrine the <hi>French</hi> Count had preacht to her: ſhe pretended great ſeverity, but yet without ſhifting the Marqueſſes hopes; My heart, ſays ſhe, prefers the love of Vertue to all the Dignities in the World, nevertheleſs it is not ſo ungrateful, but a conſiderable ſervice may have an influence upon it. In the midſt of this Conference the Princeſs apprehended ſhe heard ſome body walk behind the Paliſſade, againſt which ſhe was leaning, and ſhe trembled at the Alarm. Though the Queen had made no profeſſion of auſterity her ſelf, yet ſhe exacted it in others, and according to the Maxime
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:65131:163"/>of Court Ladies, was a declared Enemy to all other peoples Courtſhip. The Princeſs fearing therefore to be ſurpriſed alone in diſcourſe with a man, made but one leap betwixt the place where ſhe was, and the door into her Appartment; and in imitation of her, the Marqueſs made as much haſte away as he could. He that put them to the rout, ſaw nothing but their ſhadow: it was the Count of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> who obſerving her walk, had got in at one of the Gates, and was watching upon the ſame deſign as had tempted his Rival. He was in as much fear of being diſcovered as they. When he heard them he hid himſelf, and ſuſpecting nothing of the truth, he gave them as much leiſure to eſcape as they could wiſh. When by the profound ſilence after they were fled, he judged he might come forth without danger, he ſtole to the Princeſſes Window (which he knew lookt into the Garden) reſolved to knock gently, and if it were poſſible, prevail for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Converſe; but he was ſurpriſed with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſhowre of rain, which made him apprehend the Princeſs, could neither come out her ſelf, nor put her head out of the Window, ſo that he was glad to retire very melancholy upon the illneſs of his ſucceſs. As he was marching off, he perceived ſomething under his feet, which he took up, and found it like a Womans Pantoffle or high Shoe; and indeed it was one of the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s, which ſhe loſt as ſhe was running away, and durſt not ſtoop to take it up again. The Count ſeized upon it, and imagining the Lady which loſt it, muſt needs have been in great haſte to leave it behind her, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the noiſe he had heard could not be without
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:65131:164"/>Myſtery; and had a great curioſity in himſelf to find out the bottom of it. The Pantoffle being in his Judgment neceſſary to his deſign, he put it up carefully in his Pocket, and went home to his Quarters. Being there, he began to examine it particularly, and found it to be richly embroidred, and the form very handſom; he ſent one of his Servants (who w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nting no cunning) to inquire of all the Work-men in the City, for whom that Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toffle was made, and it proved to be made for a young <hi>Caſtellane,</hi> called <hi>Elvira,</hi> who was one of the Princeſſes Maids of Honour, and having excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent invention in all kind of Trimmings, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs her ſelf wore many times of her Work. The Count <hi>de Boulogne</hi> being ignorant of the ſecond De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny of the Pantoffle, contented himſelf with the firſt; and (his Intrigue with the Princeſs carrying more of honour than profit along with it) he thought it not incompatible, if he had made a little Love to the <hi>Caſtillane.</hi> She had appeared to him very pretty from his very Arrival, and if the honour of having the firſt-fruits of a Royal Heart, joyned with ſome ſecret deſigns upon the ſcore of the Count <hi>de Guyenne,</hi> had not ſollicited his deſires for the <hi>Infanta, Elvira</hi> had had the firſt of his devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He was heartily glad to find his way ſo well prepared: Lovers by the by, do not inſiſt ſo much upon Quality and Greatneſs; the Conqueſts that are moſt eaſie, are moſt acceptable with them. He built upon the foundation of a former <hi>Rendez-vous,</hi> and judging of <hi>Elviras</hi> Complexion by what he thought he knew of her already, the firſt occaſion he met with, he fancied would be favourable
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:65131:164"/>enough. Being at a Comedy in the Queens Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and a Collation afterwards, to which the Embaſſadours were invited, he took <hi>Elvira</hi> aſide towards a Baliſter, and pretending to deſire her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſome Paintings upon the Wainſcot, which he liked very well: 'Tis not theſe Paintings is the buſineſs, <hi>Elvira,</hi> ſaid he, as ſoftly as he could ſpeak, that is but the pretence of our diſcourſe: I love you, and could never be happy in an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of telling you before. I know I attempt a Fort, has been taken already, but it is the cuſtom among the <hi>French</hi> to diſpoſſeſs all Uſurpers: I am not ignorant of your affairs, it was I routed you the Queens Garden the other night: it was I made you run in ſuch haſte, and it is I have the Pantoffle in my cuſtody, which you loſt by the way. I have not told any thing of all this to any but your ſelf, and will dye a thouſand deaths before ever I will tell it, But, fair <hi>Elvira,</hi> let me remember you, ſuch diſcretion as this deſerves ſome kind of favour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe it therefore, if you pleaſe. <hi>Elvira</hi> was young, high-ſpirited, one that would not admit of an Intrigue, and for whom Nature had liberally done, what the Laws, and Education do many times find great difficulty to do. You addreſs your ſelf very ill, Monſieur, ſaid ſhe to the Count ſomething angrily, you muſt ſeek a new Object for your Romances, ſuch trifles will not reliſh with me: And what ſhe ſaid, ſhe ſpake with that Emphaſis, as bold as the Monſieur was, ſhe put him out of Countenance. Neverteleſs being aſſured, as he thought, <hi>Elvira</hi> was not ſo terrible as ſhe deſired to appear, this ſally did but redouble the ardour of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:65131:165"/>his Attaque; he watched <hi>Elviras</hi> Eyes when-ever he was permitted to ſee her: He took all lawful occaſions to make her little Preſents, he gave many Bills to the Princeſſes Maids, and found a way to inſinuate, they were intended only for her. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> more he concerned himſelf, the leſs notice ſhe took. When he talkt to her of the Garden, the <hi>Rendez-vous,</hi> and the Pantoffle, ſhe lookt upon him as diſtracted, and he (not to drive a thing too far, when he perceived ſhe delighted not to hear) took himſelf up, and pretending to believe her heart as yet undiſpoſed of, beſeeched her he might have it in that quality rather than fail: She told him very ſnappingly, ſhe would do nothing in that nature, and that ſhe was a profeſt Enemy to thoſe kind of Intrigues; but let her ſay what ſhe would he would have been ſworn to the contrary, and that it was her caution, not her humour deceived him. Well, he muſt needs know which of the two ſpoke truth: He had made but one of the Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners before, he made them all now; he underſtood the Marqueſs <hi>de Villena</hi> entred into the Garden that night he found the Pantoffle. He ſent for the Work-man that made it, and examined it himſelf; he aſſured him he made it for <hi>Elvira,</hi> ſo that the obſtinacy ſhe had expreſt, began to loſe that credit it had almoſt acquired. The Count ſuſpected it an artifice, and believing it would be meritorious to convince her of her juggling, he reſolved to take her in the act. Though he had all theſe deſigns in his head, his Intrigues with the Princeſs went on nevertheleſs: He accoſted her as oft as he could, he writ Letters to her every day, and invented an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:65131:165"/>ways to convey them; ſometimes he ſent them wrapt up in dryed Sweet-meats (and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it was he brought up that cuſtom at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, for it is ſtill practiſed in <hi>France</hi> at this day) otherwhiles he brought Verſes and Songs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the way of the <hi>French</hi> Court, and then ſtole in a Letter amongſt thoſe the Princeſs ſeemed to like. He was ſo ingenious likewiſe to cauſe a Busk of Leaf-gold to be made upon blue Enamel, all hollow within, and the Princeſs pretending to ſhew him the Workmanſhip, or playing at ſome kind of Sport where that would be neceſſary, ſhe received his Notes many times, and many times anſwered them. They were as kind as at the beginning, and (except certain degrees of benevolence which he reſerved till after his Embaſſie was concluded) he thought himſelf in as much favour as he could wiſh; but he was very much miſtaken. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs had ſatisfied the <hi>Infanta,</hi> that her Marriage with <hi>Alphonſo</hi> would be more honourable and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious, than the Count <hi>de Guyenne;</hi> and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Princeſs treating the Embaſſadours according to the quality of their Propoſals, the Prince of <hi>Caſtilles</hi> Embaſſadours had the precedence in her heart. The Marqueſs had met her by her order in the Garden, where he had found her the firſt time without it; and as his deſigns of marrying her to <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> were not ſo ſincere as the Count <hi>de Boulognes</hi> were to marry her to the Count <hi>de Guyenne;</hi> the ſtory ſays, the Marqueſs was much bolder with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Prince of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> than the Count was with thoſe of the <hi>French</hi> Prince. One evening when he was in the Queens Garden attending the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:65131:166"/>Princeſs who had promiſed to meet him without any Equipage but her Governante; the Count <hi>de Boulogne,</hi> who had his Scouts abroad, had notice where he was: he haſted privately into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Gate that was at his diſpoſing, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting at leaſt to take <hi>Elvira</hi> in a lye, he ſtole gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behind an Arbour, where the Gardiner he had made, aſſured him the Marqueſs was entred. The evening was dark, and the Princeſs, and <hi>Villena</hi> ſpake very low, nevertheleſs the Count could here the Whiſpering they made. He went round about the Arbour, and throwing himſelf into it ſuddenly; How now! Madam, ſaid he to the Princeſs, you will have no Amours not you? your <hi>Rendez vous,</hi> and the ſtory of the Pantoffles are but Romances and Fables? you have no kindneſs for the Marqueſs of <hi>Villena</hi> at all? and you are naturally, what the moſt vertuous are by Education? Part of this charge was properly enough upon the Princeſs, and had the Count been aſſured to whom he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt his Diſcourſe, his publick and private Intereſts would have authorized him to have expreſt himſelf in that manner: But the haughtineſs and quality of the <hi>Infanta</hi> would not permit her to return him any milder reply. She told the Count he was very bold to intrude himſelf into a Converſation where he was not invited; that ſhe had her reaſons for the ſecrecy of her diſcourſe with the Marqueſs, wherewith the King was already contented, and (beſides the Queen) ſhe thought her ſelf not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable to any body elſe; that he would be gone immediately, unleſs he deſired ſhe ſhould forget the reſpect ſhe had for his Dignity, as he had forgot
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:65131:166"/>what was due unto her. It is not eaſie to expreſs the aſtoniſhment the Count <hi>de Boulogne</hi> was in when he heard it was the <hi>Infanta;</hi> he thought he had been miſtaken, and interrupting her in a fright; Why, Madam, ſaid he to her, is it you that is in this Arbour? Yes, replied the <hi>Infanta</hi> in a paſſion, it is I: And this Cavalier with me is the Marqueſs <hi>de Villena?</hi> Yes, ſaid the Marqueſs, I am the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Villena,</hi> and I am in diſcourſe with the <hi>Infanta</hi> about matters of State. I ask your pardon, Madam, replied the Count out of countenance, I did not expect to have found the Marqueſs in ſo good Company, I ſhall take my meaſures better another time, and ſeeing the reſpect I owe you is expoſed by ſuch accidents undeſigned, I ſhall keep a better guard upon it for the future. Having finiſhed theſe words, he withdrew, and left the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi> in a moſt inexpreſſible diſquiet. The true cauſe ſhe concealed from the Marqueſs; that piece of ſincerity is never in uſe; but the ſcrupulous ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue wherewith the Queen did ſeem to embelliſh her older years, ſupplied the Princeſs with pretences enough for her diſorder. As ſoon as ſhe was got to her Chamber, ſhe writ a Letter to the Count, and though ſhe father'd her <hi>Rendez-vous</hi> upon the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> yet ſhe expreſt ſo ſenſible a ſorrow for the ſuſpicions he had conceived, that one muſt have been the <hi>Infanta</hi> her ſelf to have diſcovered the fallacy. This Letter by ill Fortune fell into the hands of the Marqueſs <hi>de Villena.</hi> The Princeſs had the Names of her Gallants ſo ready in her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, that ſhe confounded them, and thinking to name the Count <hi>de Boulogne,</hi> ſhe directed her Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:65131:167"/>to the Marqueſs. The Meſſenger under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding no further than what he received from her mouth for there was no Superſcription) carried it directly as the Princeſs had commanded before ſhe was aware. Such Meſſages as thoſe are uſually great interruptions to Gallants repoſe. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs ſpent the beſt part of the night in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that gracious Letter, he was immediately ſatisfied of the miſtake. The Count was ſo exactly deſcribed, he needed not have been his Rival to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it was to him. This made the Marqueſs as jealous as angry: He conſidered in what manner the Count accoſted the Princeſs, and judged her anſwer, though apparently angry, yet upon ſecond thoughts more than ordinary familiar; he dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced two or three melancholy Conſequences, and reſolved to ſecond them with Conference with the Count, he went to ſpeak with him as ſoon as he was dreſt. The Count had received a Ticket from the Princeſs, addreſt to the Marqueſs, as the Marqueſs had received one the night before intended to the Count. She had diſcovered the Deſtiny of her Letter, upon the return of her Meſſenger; and would fain have rectified it, if it were poſſible; with this deſign, ſhe conjured the Marqueſs to meet her in a Monaſtery, where ſhe was to dine that day, and where ſhe hoped to have the liberty to diſcourſe with him. The faults of Servants have ſuch a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive concatenation, they are neither to be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor prevented. The Princeſs had given ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a Lecture to him that carried the Letter, for having delivered it to Marqueſs <hi>de Villena,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itered with ſo confuſed a tranſport, that what ſhe
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:65131:167"/>writ, was for the Count <hi>de Boulogne,</hi> that his name ran ſtill in his head, inſomuch as he miſtook again and carried the Ticket to the Count. He was juſt reading it when the Marqueſs came in, and <hi>Villena</hi> ſeeing him go out who brought the Note, and knowing him to be the ſame perſon who had brought him the Letter the evening before; This Officer of the Princeſs, ſaid he to the Count, hath prevented my zeal but a moment, I am come to deliver you the Letter which without doubt he has told you did belong to you. He told me but one thing (and that I am not much concerned to know) replied the Count; which is, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs goes this day to dinner in a Monaſtery in this City; you who have more affairs to treat with her than I have, and who chuſes ſuch private places for your tranſactions, may, if you pleaſe, make your advantage of this; and giving him the Ticket, he bade him look where it was. The Marqueſs was named in it, ſo the Count made no ſcruple to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it to him. Ha! truly, ſaid the Marqueſs ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling when he had read it, this Adventure is pretty; the Princeſs I preceive would not leave us any thing wherewith to reproach one another, and I ſhould have had the advantage too much, ſhould I have given you the Letter ſhe writ to you, unleſs you had had the ſame Preſent for me. Having ſaid thoſe words, he thruſt it into his hands. The Count read it, and going on afterwards in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; The Princeſs, ſaid he, takes more pains than ſhe needs, I am too wiſe to do her any injury, and too incredulous to be deceived. But, Sir, ſaid he to the Marqueſs, may I ask you, how long is it
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:65131:168"/>ſince you have been in poſſeſſion of the Princeſſes favours? for knowing ſo much as I do, I ſuppoſe you will not be deſirous to make it a ſecret; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Sir, we are both guilty of the ſame indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, replied the Marqueſs, I am no more ignorant of your affairs, than you are of mine, and I think the Princeſs is not worthy of your Cautions, when we reflect upon the way ſhe hath treated us. The two Lovers being ſtrangely irritated, but poſſeſſ with a paſſion too indifferent to produce any Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical effects, entred into an entire intimacy upon the ſcore of their Adventures, and reſolved to be revenged by defeating her Marriage with either of the Princes from whom they were imployed. But they had not the pleaſure of that revenge, <hi>Alphonſo</hi> and the Count <hi>de Guyenne</hi> dying about the ſame time, and the King of <hi>Caſtille</hi> following not long after, the Princeſſes Deſtiny conducted her into <hi>Portugal,</hi> where ſhe failed not without doubt to put her old Maxims in practice. But I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver get the true Memoires of the reſt of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues. All I could learn was only this, that after ſeveral Adventures, a Ray of Grace confined her to a Monaſtery of Saint <hi>Clares,</hi> where ſhe ended her life with moſt exemplary devotion. The Count <hi>de Boulogne</hi> (who knowing her humour, lookt upon her retirement but as ſome amorous diſcontent) communicated his thoughts to ſo many people, that the Tradition is come down as far as us, and I have related, as I received it: and thus finding the third, Tome of our Annals ſufficiently large, I make haſte to acquit my ſelf of my fourth.</p>

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:65131:169"/>Uſurpations, he reſolved it in one of his Royal Feaſts, ſo famous in that Country, where it is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned a crime no leſs than mortal to appeal from the Decrees pronounced at ſuch times. The Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of that Empire having been long prepared for that Alliance, had approved it before, and the pain annext to the infringement of that Law, tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any repugnancy the Princeſs could conſerve againſt the Family of that Tyrant; there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing expected but the Concluſion of that Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the delivering up certain Provinces which as yet remained faithful to their lawful Prince; but in ſuch caſes the ſuffrage of the people is not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſary, as a concurrence of Love: Which admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no Laws but its own; Prince <hi>Caly</hi> underſtood thoſe of his Country in vain, and could not bring his heart to a compliance therewith. He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately enamour'd of a Kinſwoman of his, called <hi>Zuria,</hi> and his paſſion being ſecret, was the more violent. He did what he could to reſiſt this incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but finding it grow higher by depreſſion, he ſent for his Brother, and made him his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent both of his Love, and deſpair. Nor indeed could he have choſen one more ſincere, for beſides the perfect amity betwixt them, <hi>Chaſan</hi> had an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent affection for <hi>Imerſelle:</hi> he never durſt declare it to her, becauſe he thought her too worthy of the Empire, and ſo too high for any Subject to marry; beſides he knew the Order of Nature had deſigned her for his Brother. How! Sir, ſaid he, when the Prince told him he could not love <hi>Imerſelle,</hi> is the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia</hi> offered to you, and you will not accept? I know her Excellencies well enough, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:65131:169"/>the Prince; but I am obliged by ſo ſtrong ligaments to <hi>Zuria,</hi> that I am not able to break them. I muſt confeſs <hi>Imerſelle</hi> is beautiful, I muſt confeſs ſhe is vertuous, and I know in prudence I ſhould look no further. But, dear Brother, I have no ſooner made this reflexion, but I find I know not what ebullition in my mind that oppoſes it immediately. My mind will not be ſubdued by the dictates of my reaſon, the Beauty of <hi>Imerſelle</hi> affects my Eye, but makes no impreſſion at my heart; and whatever I endeavour for her to no purpoſe; I feel naturally for <hi>Zuria</hi> without any conſtraint. Ha! Sir, replied <hi>Chaſan,</hi> you ſhall find more people with the ſame paſſion for <hi>Imerſelle,</hi> which you have for <hi>Zuria,</hi> than you ſhall find on the contrary: Nothing in this World is ſo perfect as <hi>Imerſelle,</hi> nor nothing in this World ſo deſirable. Ha! dear Brother, cryed the Prince embracing him, if I be not miſtaken, I diſcern you, you love <hi>Imerſelle</hi> without doubt, and though Fortune hath done me a diſpleaſure, I ſee ſhe hath provided me a remedy: Is it poſſible that in robbing my ſelf of a thing I abhor, I ſhould be ſerviceable to a Brother I love ſo entirely? It is but too poſſible that I love <hi>Imer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle,</hi> replied <hi>Chaſan,</hi> for my paſſion for her is as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as my reaſon. But, Sir, which way will that be a remedy to you? you muſt reſolve to dye, or marry the Princeſs. Our Father is ſevere, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the Revolt of a people he hath conquered, who do ſtill retain an inclination to their natural Prince: He will never encourage their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, by diſpenſing with yours; and (I cannot ſpeak it but with horrour). I have too much reaſon
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:65131:170"/>to believe he will puniſh it in you as ſeverely as in the meaneſt of his Subjects; What advantage to you then, if I admire <hi>Imerſelle?</hi> will my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune be a diminution to yours? and will you think your ſelf the leſs miſerable for my being ſo too? We muſt try what we can to be neither of us ſo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Scach Caly,</hi> the <hi>Sophy</hi> is old, and I cannot think will make over-much haſte to conſummate our Marriage: He hath a troubleſom War upon his hands will give him impediment for a while; let us make uſe of the preſent, and leave futurity to the diſpoſition of the Heavens. Having ſaid thus, he propoſed that Prince <hi>Chaſan</hi> ſhould make Love to <hi>Imerſelle</hi> in his Name. We ſhall have no great task to obtain conveniencies, continued Prince <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> we are of the ſame ſtature, and have the ſame voice, let us commit the reſt to the Conduct of Love. It was not many days after this reſolution was taken, before the Princes met an occaſion for an Eſſay: The Prince <hi>Imerſe</hi> was retired to the Court of <hi>Bajazet</hi> II. Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who had given hopes of reſtoring him to the Throne of his Fathers. <hi>Campſon,</hi> Sultan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> declared Enmity to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> being glad to divert thoſe Troops which might otherwiſe be imployed againſt him, ſent <hi>Thoman Bey</hi> (who ſucceeded him in that Monarchy) to the <hi>Sophy,</hi> to offer him Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and conjure him to an Union. This Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was too much to <hi>Iſmaels</hi> advantage to be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; he received the Embaſſadour very honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and to do ſomething the <hi>Egyptian</hi> might more particularly apply to his own eſteem and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's, the Court of <hi>Perſia</hi> invented Dances <hi>à l' Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptienne,</hi>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:65131:170"/>in which they danced masked, and habited after the manner of <hi>Egypt.</hi> This Diſguiſe furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Princes with the opportunity they wanted, they cauſed their Habits to be made exactly alike, and <hi>Caly</hi> giving place to his Brother, and paying him all the reſpects that might ſignifie him to be elder Brother, he got the liberty to be with <hi>Zuria,</hi> whilſt <hi>Chaſan</hi> ſupplied his place next <hi>Imerſelle.</hi> The Princeſs <hi>Imerſelle</hi> found her falſe <hi>Caly</hi> much more paſſionate than her true one: he expreſt himſelf ſo zealouſly, and in ſuch terms, as the ſincerity of her old <hi>Caly</hi> could not diſpenſe with: one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of this Ball was, that they ſhould have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſteal little diſcourſes whilſt it laſted, and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan</hi> received thoſe his good Fortune gave him with the Princeſs, with ſo great tranſportation, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was ſurpriſed. I believe, Sir, ſaid ſhe to him ſmiling, the Habit you wear hath ſome ſecret pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety to make you amorous, you never appeared ſo much to me before, and 'tis no longer ago than laſt night, I was telling the Princeſs <hi>Zuria,</hi> your Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, that if your coolneſs continued, I ſhould be the firſt would expoſe my ſelf to the rigour of the Law, rather than ſee you obey the <hi>Sophy</hi> with ſo much reluctancy. Diſguiſe, Madam, replied <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> is many times ſo neceſſary to Love, Lovers can ſpeak nothing paſſionately without it; It is not the Command of the <hi>Sophy</hi> that brings me thus near you, it is the deſire of my own heart; I might be another, not <hi>Caly,</hi> without yours or my Fathers perceiving it: But my heart acting by peculiar Principles of its own, without any foreign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, it is Love which ſpeaks by my mouth, and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:65131:171"/>not the <hi>Sophy</hi>'s Decree that excites me. But this Love, is it more conſtrained in my Cloſet, replied <hi>Imerſelle,</hi> or in another place you pleaſe to chuſe, than in the confuſion of ſo great an Aſſembly? Were we of thoſe kind of Lovers to whom all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of Converſe were interdicted, or whoſe actions were expoſed to the eyes of our Enemies, I ſhould not wonder you ſhould want a Diſguiſe to declare your affection; but by his direction, to whom Nature and Fortune hath obliged us both, you may impart it how, where, and as often as you pleaſe; all places are proper, and all expreſſions allowed you; how comes it then you have been ſo indifferent before, and are ſo vehement now? The Prince would have been put to ſome trouble to have anſwered this ſecond queſtion, had not the Company broke up, and relieved them. His Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and he ran to the Window, as it had been to take a little air, and returning without their Masks, <hi>Scach Caly</hi> was obliged to give <hi>Imerſelle</hi> his hand, and to wait upon her to her Appartment; but it was done with a coldneſs ſo unconformable to the Diſcourſe ſhe had had before, that ſhe could not but admire the difference. The <hi>Sophy</hi> believing it had been his eldeſt Son that entertained <hi>Imerſelle</hi> all the while, and perceiving him whom he took to be his ſecond, to keep cloſe to <hi>Zuria,</hi> he fancied he was in Love with her, and was not diſpleaſed; <hi>Chaſan,</hi> ſaid he to him next morning, I am ſenſible of the ſecret inclinations of your heart; fatherly Love is full of obſervation, and I have diſcovered that which perhaps you never intended I ſhould ſee. I might complain that you conſulted me not; but I
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:65131:171"/>am a good Father, and will impute that want of reſpect, to the impetuoſity of a paſſion, which by my own experience I know is not to be maſter'd by perſons of your age. <hi>Chaſan</hi> could not at firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect what ſhould cauſe this Errour in the <hi>Sophy;</hi> he ſuſpected he had diſcovered him by ſome or other of his geſtures, whilſt he was in Conference with <hi>Imerſelle,</hi> and that preferring the ſatisfaction of his Children to the rigour of his Laws, he would not conſtrain their inclinations. Is it poſſible, Sir, your paternal Love ſhould have ſo excellent an efficacy? replied <hi>Chaſan;</hi> Yes, dear Son, it has, replied <hi>Iſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> and I give you my inviolable word; the ſame day your elder Brother marries the Princeſs of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> the ſame day you ſhall marry your Couſin <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi> His Couſin, Sir? replied <hi>Caly,</hi> who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the promiſe. Yes, his Couſin, replied the <hi>Sophy,</hi> I obſerved him diſcourſing with her laſt night, as with a perſon not indifferent to him, and though I might well diſpoſe of him otherwiſe, yet ſuch is my indulgence, I ſhall gratifie his deſires. It was very lucky that the <hi>Sophy</hi> went into his Cloſet as ſoon as he had ſpoke theſe words: the Princes diſcompoſure had diſcovered that which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to conceal: They retired to their Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo afflicted and confuſed, they had ſcarce power to contain themſelves from murmuring. How! ſaid <hi>Chaſan,</hi> is it not ſufficient to ſatisfie the rigour of my Deſtiny, that I have loved a Princeſs from my Childhood, and dare not hope to injoy it? But I muſt marry one I neither can, nor ought to love, Is it nothing, ſaid <hi>Caly,</hi> that I muſt be deprived of <hi>Zuria,</hi> but I muſt be forced to marry <hi>Imerſelle?</hi>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:65131:172"/>and my Brother whom I love as my ſelf, muſt he become the only Perſon in the World I ought to hate? How! <hi>Zuria</hi> muſt be married to <hi>Chaſan?</hi> then <hi>Chaſan</hi> it is I muſt eſteem the only ruine and ſupplanter of my happineſs. It ſhall never be, Sir, replied the young Prince, I can love no body but <hi>Imerſelle,</hi> and therefore will never be married to <hi>Zuria.</hi> You would marry her, replied the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate <hi>Caly,</hi> could you but conceive the ſecret Charms wherewith ſhe effacinates the hearts of all that approach her, could you but diſcern the ſweetneſs of her Wit, the excellence of her Soul, and the obliging way ſhe has in all her actions. Ha! dear Brother, 'tis impoſſible you ſhould ſee that Princeſs with the leaſt aſſiduity, but you muſt needs be in Love with her. I am afraid rather, replied <hi>Chaſan,</hi> you will not be able to defend your ſelf againſt the tranſcendencies of <hi>Imerſelle,</hi> when you come to obſerve her with more intention. No, you are ſecure againſt that danger, replied Prince <hi>Caly,</hi> interrupting him, I have had tryal already of the Charms of <hi>Imerſelle,</hi> and I find they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon me; but you having as yet had no conflict with <hi>Zuria,</hi> your firſt muſt of neceſſity be mortal. After they had a long time tormented one another in this manner, they went together to <hi>Imerſelles</hi> Lodgings, and found the Princeſs <hi>Zuria</hi> with her; had Love been to have diſpoſed of their places, the Princes had known how to have choſen them well enough. But <hi>Zuria</hi> being fearful of the life of her Prince, would not ſuffer him to ſpeak privately with her in the preſence of the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia;</hi> and <hi>Chaſan</hi> apprehending <hi>Imerſelles</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:65131:172"/>durſt not owne his paſſion without his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe. The conſtraint they ſuffered in not having the liberty of their own inclinations, was conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly viſible in their faces. <hi>Zuria</hi> took notice of <hi>Caly</hi>'s diſtraction, and applied all the conſolation the kindneſs of her glances could contribute; and the more ſhe applied, the more his diſquiet was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. The Princeſs of <hi>Perſia</hi> imagining the Prince at that time ſo melancholy and dejected, was the ſame who the night before was ſo vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and brave, ſhe upbraided him by his puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and he knew not how to defend himſelf. They ſpent all the afternoon in this doleful imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the evening being come, the Princes hoping for more favours from its obſcurity, than from the clearneſs of the day. They propoſed to the Princeſſes to take a Walk; they accepted of the motion, and all four went down into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den together: <hi>Scach-Caly</hi> led <hi>Imerſelle,</hi> and <hi>Chaſan Zuria;</hi> the Prince lookt back every ſtep he went, to ſee if <hi>Zuria</hi>'s Beauty had not produced the effects he preſaged. By the actions of his Brother, it ſeemed to him his Propheſie was falſe, and whilſt they were in the light, his ſuſpicions were tolerable, but when they came into the dark Alley, and he could not ſee what paſſed betwixt them, he loſt all conſideration, and cryed out, without knowing what he ſaid, he will be in Love withher, doubtleſs he will be in Love with her; it is impoſſible for him to defend himſelf: Who do you ſpeak of? ſaid <hi>Imerſelle</hi> interrupting him, and griping him by the hand. The Prince was troubled to find he had betrayed himſelf, and doing what he could to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect;
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:65131:173"/>It is my Brother, Madam, I ſpeak to, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he. He has often told me he is Beauty-proof, and that no Woman living was able to make any impreſſion upon him; I was unwilling he ſhould have that advantage of me, and therefore I intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Couſin to uſe what Art ſhe could to ſubdue him. Will you pleaſe, Madam, and we will liſten to hear how ſhe ſucceeds? The word was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er out of his mouth, but he ran the Princeſs up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Hedge, and thruſt himſelf by her: It was dark in that Alley in the day time, and was not to be expected it ſhould be lighter, when it was dark every where elſe. <hi>Chaſan</hi> and his Couſin paſt juſt by <hi>Imerſelle</hi> and the Prince without perceiving them in the leaſt, and <hi>Caly</hi> heard what his Brother diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; It is that, ſaid he, will be one day the greateſt of our pleaſures. A deelared Intrigue is but flat and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid; Love is never ſo well ſetled, as where no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſuſpects its reſidence. <hi>Chaſan</hi> ſpoke theſe words upon the ſcore of his paſſion for the Princeſs of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia;</hi> but <hi>Caly</hi>'s Jealouſie would not admit of that interpretation; he underſtood all according to the depravity of his own ſenſe, and that imagination over-powring his Judgment, he ran immediately to his Brother, and left his Princeſs without her Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-Uſher. <hi>Chaſan</hi> heard one behind him, and demanding who was there, <hi>Caly</hi> quickly informed him, by thruſting him haſtily from <hi>Zuria,</hi> and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him he had ſupplied that place long enough; he intimated thereby that his place with <hi>Imerſelle</hi> was vacant. <hi>Chaſan</hi> ran to the Princeſs to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Myſtery of the <hi>Egyptian;</hi> he found her highly diſguſted with the manner in which <hi>Caly</hi>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:65131:173"/>had quitted her, ſhe was got as far as the end of the Alley, to have called her Women, and gone back to her Lodgings: But <hi>Chaſan</hi> ſtopt her by the Gown, and deſired the reaſon of her retreat. Here is no need of me, Sir, ſaid ſhe twitching her Gown out of his hand, and doubling her pace. The young Prince imagined preſently <hi>Caly</hi> had diſcovered ſomething of his Love to <hi>Zuria,</hi> and being defirous, if poſſible, to repair it: But, fair Princeſs, ſaid he to <hi>Imerſelle,</hi> holding her ſtill by the Gown, do not uſe me ſo ſeverely, I beſeech you, I am not capable of any deſire that may offend you; if before I was aware I have done any thing has diſpleaſed you; See, Madam, I am ready to dye in expiation. This ſubmiſſion of <hi>Chaſan,</hi> whom ſhe took all the while for <hi>Caly,</hi> did in ſome meaſure qualifie her anger: ſhe loved not that Prince, but as one he thought de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be her Husband; but ſhe was high, knew well ſhe deſerved all the reſpects of a Lover, and could not brook the indifferencies of <hi>Caly.</hi> She made her reproaches therefore to <hi>Chaſan,</hi> miſtaking him for <hi>Caly,</hi> which he found by their fierceneſs to proceed from a real diſpleaſure. You indulge my affection perhaps more than you intend, when you let me fee ſo much of your indignation: it is too violent to be the effect of an ordinary cauſe: You love doubtleſs, for ſo immoderate an anger goes ſeldom unaccompanied with a proportion of the other. Do not you flatter your ſelf with that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, replied <hi>Imerſelle,</hi> if I love you, it is only ſo far as I am forced by the Commands of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</hi> Before I was obliged to marry you by that irrevocable Decree, I lookt upon you as there had
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:65131:174"/>been no ſuch man, and (by a blind inſtinct from I know not what cauſe) had I conſulted my own heart, I ſhould have found there Prince <hi>Chaſans</hi> intereſt much greater than yours. <hi>Chaſans,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam? replied the Prince. Yes <hi>Chaſans,</hi> replied <hi>Imerſelle,</hi> his deportment accommodates much more with my humour than yours: he has more Complacency for me than you, and I find a ſecret propenſity in me to do him what ſervice I can. Ha! Madam, cryed <hi>Chaſan,</hi> interrupting her, do not ſuppreſs that propenſity, I beſeech you. <hi>Chaſan</hi> is equally dear to me with my ſelf, his advantages are mine, I feel all his deſires, I participate of his joys, and I cannot be happy but in his good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. I ſaid not what I did, replied the Princeſs, to put you upon that declaration: I am ſenſible how I am ingaged by the Laws of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and the Sympathy I have for your Brother, will not make me hazard my life by making him my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; nor indeed do I know whether he would deſire it, we have never diſcourſed of any ſuch thing, but I am glad I have this opportunity to let you know that 'tis my Honour, and nothing elſe, is exaſperated by your ſlights. Find but a way of enfranchizing me from the penalty of the Decree; reſtore me but once freely to my ſelf, and diſpoſe of your ſelf afterward as you pleaſe, I'le aſſure you I ſhall not be concerned, but whilſt I continue under the ingagement that is upon me, I expect it ſhould be reciprocal, and you ſenſible of your obligation as well as my ſelf. This Diſcourſe drawing on <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan</hi> into a Converſation he did not like, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to perſonate <hi>Caly</hi> all the reſt of the Walk:
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:65131:174"/>he beg'd her pardon for what he had not done, and made a thouſand prayers and proteſtations: They had the true Character of Love, that paſſion is never more prodigal of its favours than at the time of reconciliation. <hi>Chaſan</hi> had a Ring given him by the Princeſs off of her finger upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that whenever ſhe was required by that Signal to perform her ingagement, ſhe would chearfully receive him for her Husband. The Prince <hi>Caly</hi> had almoſt the ſame aſſurances from <hi>Zuria;</hi> ſhe could not (whatever ſhe ſaid) reſolve to expoſe a perſon ſhe loved ſo entirely, to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of his Father: But Love having inſpired him with thoughts of running to ſome Sanctuary, ſhe conſented, and obliged her ſelf that when-ever they found themſelves reduced to that neceſſity, ſhe would readily ſubmit. Theſe favourable hopes quieted the diſorders of the two Brothers; they paſt that night with more tranquillity than they had done five or ſix before; but their ſleep was a Cheat, which inchanted them for ſome hours, only to make their ſorrows the more ſenſible when they waked. The Prine <hi>Imerſe</hi> having advertiſement of <hi>Iſmaels</hi> deſigns upon the perſon of his Siſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing averſe to that Alliance, and retaining a juſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the Uſurper of his Throne, he reſolved to attempt any thing might obſtruct the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Marriage. The <hi>Sophy</hi> held his Court at that time at <hi>Xiras,</hi> the Capital City of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in <hi>Perſia.</hi> This City preſerved a fidelity for its Prince, which all <hi>Iſmaels</hi> Authority could never eradicate; <hi>Imerſe</hi> ſent private Agents to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Inhabitants, remonſtrated the trouble it would
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:65131:175"/>be to him to ſee his blood confounded with the blood of his implacable Enemy; and conjured them, if they could poſſibly, to prevent that diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement by ſtealing <hi>Imerſelle</hi> away: His Agents acquitted themſelves ſo well of their Commiſſion, that the very night after the Walk we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia</hi> was ſurpriſed, and the Princeſs <hi>Zuria</hi> with her, who unfortunately for <hi>Caly,</hi> lay that night with <hi>Imerſelle.</hi> The Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe was performed without any great noiſe; the Princeſſes Lodging in a quarter of the Palace, a good diſtance from the <hi>Sophys</hi> Appartment; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the deſign were let in by the Princeſſes Women, who were moſt of them related ſome way or other to the heads of the Party, and the Prince <hi>Imerſe</hi> having charged them with expreſs Order under his Hand, that his Siſter might not miſtake, there was only <hi>Zurias</hi> skreeks to be prevented, which were ſtopt before ſhe was well awake. They clapt the Princeſſes into a Coach which attended on purpoſe, conveyed them out of a Gate they had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and following the Road to <hi>Texel</hi> with all ſpeed, they were received into that Town by <hi>Imerſe,</hi> and the Sultan <hi>Selim,</hi> the Son of <hi>Bajazet</hi> II. who in the name of his Father had the Command of all <hi>Phrygia.</hi> It is eaſie to imagine the affliction of the two Princes at this ſorrowful News; they mounted immediately, and being followed by the whole Court they endeavoured to diſcover which way theſe Raviſhers were gone; but they could have no information, till it was too late to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them: They ſeemed to be inconſolable, and their Love not being to be confined within the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:65131:175"/>bounds of ſimple grief, they reſolved to get to their Princeſſes, if they could, and try all ways poſſible, for their relief. They took upon them the Habit of certain new <hi>Derviſes</hi> of the Sect of <hi>Scaydar,</hi> who was a famous Commentator upon the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and from whom they were deſcended, and alluding the Cautions of their old Father, they took their way towards <hi>Phrygia.</hi> They had not marcht far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had News of what they ſought after: The Sultan <hi>Selim</hi> was fallen in Love with <hi>Imerſelle</hi> at firſt ſight, and <hi>Imerſe</hi> had as great a paſſion for <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi> their Loves were ſo conſpieuous by their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick magnificences, there was ſcarce one perſon ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it in the whole Country. Our loving <hi>Derviſes</hi> were almoſt diſtracted at the Report, they haſtened their march, and in a ſhort time were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced within half a days Journey of <hi>Cibotis,</hi> called otherwiſe <hi>Apamia,</hi> where the Sultan <hi>Selim</hi> held his Court. They took up their habitations in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart near the River <hi>Meandre;</hi> a Grot with two or three murmuring Fountains were preſented to them by Chance, as it had been by Command. Such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as they had been conſtrained to bring along with them, they ſent into the City, to ſupply ſuch things as they wanted, and to diffuſe the noiſe of their extraordinary Vertue among the people, which was ſo effectually performed, they were not long before they were viſited by all the Bigots and Fanaticks in Mahumetiſm. They entertained their devout Viſitants with Diſcourſes only of the Vanity of this World, and the ſolid pleaſure in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the next. It is a general Maxime, the hypocritical Devout is always more eloquent
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:65131:176"/>than the true, their ſoul is full of nothing but it ſelf, the humility of good men, and meditation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what they are to treat, and this Evangelical ſimplicity (which is the imitable Character of true piety) adding much to the riches of their expreſſion, they become very ſtrong and powerful in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions. Our pretended <hi>Derviſes</hi> joyning to their Hypocriſie, a high natural Wit, made ſo great a progreſs among the Inhabitants of <hi>Texel,</hi> that in a ſhort time the News of them came to the ears of Sultan <hi>Selim.</hi> The new <hi>Scaydars</hi> were not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned but as the eldeſt Sons of Prophets, and (by an uſual Hyperbole in ſuch occaſions) ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons affirmed they had ſeen them do Miracles, who never heard of them but from the mouth of ſome fantaſtical Enthuſiaſt, or the relation of ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Emiſſaries of their own. This high reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion drawing upon them the eſteem of the Sultan, he ſent Preſents to the pretended <hi>Derviſes,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring them to recommend him to their Prophet. They promiſed him their interceſſion, but his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents they returned, pretending they renounced all things belonging to this World; and had now no Commerce but with the Angles. This Anſwer moved the Curioſity of <hi>Selim,</hi> he made an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Prince <hi>Imerſe,</hi> to make them a Viſit: The two Princes had advertiſement of their deſign; they had their Spies in the Town, who obſerved and gave notice of the motions of their Rivals: They ſtudied gravity for ſome time wherewith they might receive them; and <hi>Selim</hi> being arrived at their Cave, they knew ſo well how to furniſh it with ſuch things as might perſwade him of their
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:65131:176"/>Sanctity, that the beſt piece of Houſhold-ſtuff to be ſeen, was the inſtrument they kept to mortifie their fleſh. The Inventory almoſt frighted the two <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſoes,</hi> they were afraid of profaning ſo holy a place, and the <hi>Derviſes</hi> ſeconding their Errour; Moſt dear Children of our great Prophet, ſaid <hi>Caly</hi> to them, be not fearful to approach the moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servants of the Eternal, 'tis for your ſakes only we are ſent into this Province, and it is the charitable care the Heavens take of your Conduct, that has put it into your hearts to viſit us. Hark, you Sultan <hi>Selim;</hi> Hark, you Prince <hi>Imerſe,</hi> the Stars do look upon you with a malevolent Aſpect, and you have a ſtrong diſpoſition to follow their malign Influence: Our Divine Prophet has thought you worthy of his own direction in ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous a paſſage, and we are the ſacred Interpreters of his adorable intentions. At theſe words ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ſacred Interpreters, delegated to them from ſo venerable a Prophet; the Sultan <hi>Selim</hi> and Prince <hi>Imerſe,</hi> made a moſt profound Reverence, and proteſting they would receive with as much ſubmiſſion as ſaith, the divine Decrees it ſhould pleaſe thoſe <hi>Scaydars</hi> to pronounce, they humbly intreated they would vouchſafe to begin the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Miſſion. The counterfeit <hi>Derviſes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it beſt to pretend as much difficulty as they could, to confirm their Rivals in their credulity. The Myſteries of Heaven are neither explained, nor received with ſo little preparation, ſaid <hi>Chaſan,</hi> there muſt be prayers, and auſterities to open the ſacred Repoſitiories of the Celeſtial graces: You have a heart repleat with mundane deſires, how
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:65131:177"/>can you believe, till they be expelled, there ſhould be room for divine Inſpirations? Purge, purge away the pollutions wherewith that is defiled, and then our great Prophet will repleniſh you with ſuch ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutriferous emanations as he has reſerved for you: Love, hatred, and ambition are like ſo many Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts in your Soul, force your ſelves what you can to calm them, excite your ſelves what you can to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, deprive your ſelves of the ſight of ſuch objects, as produce thoſe turbulencies in your ſoul; we do not name them, becauſe our revelation tell us, you will divine even that, of which we think not convenient to remember you. But, dear Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, let us acquaint you, we are not ignorant of the moſt ſecret of your thoughts; and when you ſhall be worthily prepared for our inſtructions, ſhall tell you ſuch things as will ſurpriſe you: God then, and put your ſelves into a condition to merit that boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wherewith the Heavens are pleaſed to favour you; and when you judge your ſouls in ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture as is required, repair to us again, and be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther informed. Theſe cunning <hi>Derviſes</hi> referred the Rivals to a ſecond Conference, as well to agree upon what they were to ſay, as not to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuſpected of a premeditated deſign; and this adjournment producing the effect they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Sultan calculated the importance of their advice, by the difficulty they made of giving it: he thought he might from theſe Holy perſons draw ſuch wholeſom inſtructions as might direct him in the conduct of his whole life. Theſe Fathers have a ſtrict Communication with Heaven, ſaid he to Prince <hi>Imerſe,</hi> the brightneſs of their vertue blazing
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:65131:177"/>in their actions, and there is a Character of piety ſo viſible in their faces, it ſeems to be expanded by the divine hands of that great Prophet himſelf: <hi>Imerſe</hi> concurred exactly in <hi>Selims</hi> obſervations, and both of them projecting to make their advantage of the Preſent Heaven had made them of theſe wonderful men, they ſent to give them an account of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations they had made for a ſecond Viſit, and to deſire their opinions, whether they were ſufficient. The Princes ſent them word, no: They had ſent out their Scouts for more news; and from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which came to ſee them, wheedled out ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence as was neceſſary for their deſign, they had a mind to gain more time to compleat their informations, and contented themſelves to ſend them this ſingle Injunction, that above all things they ſhould forbear the Converſation of Women, leſt they ſhould abuſe the authority their Director had given them; there was no ſort of penance but they exacted from their Rivals; they made them faſt, they made them watch; and their ſubtleties extended to greater tryals than thoſe: But at length, ſuppoſing themſelves ſufficiently inlighted, they let fall their ſecret perſecution; and the day for their ſecond Viſit being appointed, the abuſed Princes came again to their Grot. The anger of Heaven, ſaid <hi>Chaſan</hi> to them as ſoon as he ſaw them, begins to diſpel, the inſtance of your prayers, and the piety of your works, have mollified the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of that ſentence Stars ſeemed to pronounce againſt you: And that you may believe we ſpeak not of our ſelves, you ſhall hear what our great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet has revealed to us; You, Sultan <hi>Selim,</hi> ſaid he
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:65131:178"/>to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince, taking him afide, you have drawn down the divine diſpleaſure upon your head, by a ſecret animoſity you had againſt your Brother <hi>Mahumet;</hi> you would have been preſerred before him to the Government of <hi>Amaſia,</hi> and not ſucceeding in your deſign, the deſpight you concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved prevailed with you to excite the people of that Province to complain of him ſo vigorouſly, their complaints coſt him his life. Do not I tell you true, Sir, ſaid <hi>Chaſan?</hi> The Sultan was forced to confeſs, he had actually committed all he was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with, and having added ſomething of his own, he confirmed the <hi>Dervis</hi> in whatever their perquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had cauſed them to ſuſpect. The Heavens, juſtly incenſed againſt you for ſo deteſtable a crime, continued he, has provoked you to the Love of a Princeſs of <hi>Perſia,</hi> which will be certainly your ruine: It is decreed, and our great Prophet has ſent us on purpoſe to give you advice; but your, and our prayers begin to incline him. He was a man, as you are, and though his humanity was ſuſtained by divine Qualifications, he knows nevertheleſs how far the frailties of your Nature may carry you: Let that Princeſs be brought hither, let her Attendants be as few as they can, for we delight not to converſe with more in this World than is neceſſary for your preſervation; and for no other reaſon, but for the accompliſhment of our Prophets deſigns, could we be induced to any private Entertainment with Womankind: But we know our inſtructions, and it is for the execution of them only we are come into this Province. The Sultan was ſo reſpectful, and ſo ſerious in his attention, the counterfeit <hi>Dervis</hi>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:65131:178"/>had much ado to compoſe himſelf, and retain the gravity required: nor was <hi>Caly</hi> in the mean time under leſſer temptation; he was gotten into the particulars of all <hi>Imerſes</hi> affairs. That Prince had ingenuouſly confeſt all the Circumſtances of the ſtealing the Princeſſes, named the perſons with whom he had Intelligence in <hi>Xiras,</hi> and diſcovered ſeveral other Secrets of importance, which the <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis</hi> fiſht out of him by pretending he knew all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and demanded his recapitulation, as a mark only of his ſubmiſſion to the will of the Prophet, and paſſing from matters of State, to matters of Love; You are in Love, Sir, ſaid he, with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Zuria,</hi> the preſcience where with we are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, gave us information of that Love, even before it was conceived: But, Sir, let me tell you, you will meet with great difficulties in that Enterpriſe, it is not at all pleaſing to our divine Prophet, and you will make him a Sacrifice infinitely grateful, if you ſurmount that paſſion, and deſiſt: Ha: holy Father, replied <hi>Imerſe,</hi> it is not poſſible to ſurmount it; if any thing could have prevailed, the Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſeverity would have done it: ſhe is inſenſible of all my pains, and recieved my offers with moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable neglect. Without doubt, replied <hi>Caly,</hi> her heart is prepoſſeſt in favour of ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Has not the Sultan <hi>Selim,</hi> think you, made no impreſſion there; he is young, he is handſom, has his juſt expectation of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Throne, and I am afraid (by what I obſerve in the Conſtellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) that Prince will betray the confidence you have in him. If he muſt betray me, replied <hi>Imerſe,</hi> it is not upon this occaſion; he is extravagantly
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:65131:179"/>in Love with my Siſter, and the Princeſs for whom my paſſion is ſo violent, has no leſs indifference for all the World than for me: Yet I cannot but think her of an amorous temper, replied the <hi>Dervis,</hi> ſhe is born under a Planet not guilty of ſuch indifferent Influences, and I dare promiſe I could find out a place in her heart capable of thoſe impreſſions, had I but diſcourſed with her as long as I have done with you. How! I beſeech you, ſaid <hi>Imerſe</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him, will you vouchſafe to diſcourſe with her, and I will bring her to you when-ever you pleaſe; ſhe will make no ſcruple of coming, ſhe has already an extreme curioſity to ſee you, and when the other day I gave her a deſcription of your perſon, I obſerved an emotion in her countenance ſo great, as I thought ſhe had not been capable of. I commend her zeal, replied <hi>Caly,</hi> the deſire of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons eminent for their piety, is a happy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative to their imitation. Heaven does not grant thoſe graces to all the World, and I know by that, <hi>Zuria</hi> is a Darling of the divine Prophet, upon which aſſurance you ſhall obtain that act of charity from me when you pleaſe. But it muſt be ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the time that was aſſigned us for our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of men, is now almoſt expired; and we muſt ere long leave our aſſociation with prophane perſons, to renew our Commerce with the Angels. The credulous <hi>Imerſe</hi> knockt his knees with a holy trepidation at the <hi>Derviſes</hi> news, and making the bargain as ſtrong as he could, for the next day, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim</hi> obtained of <hi>Chaſan,</hi> that <hi>Imerſelle</hi> might bear her Company. The <hi>Derviſes</hi> ſlept but little the night before that bleſſed Enterview; <hi>Caly</hi>'s joy
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:65131:179"/>produced tranſports incompatible with his repoſe, and his Brothers apprehenſions kept him as watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful on the other ſide. He was afraid to find <hi>Imer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle</hi> prepoſſeſt with kindneſs for the Sultan, he was handſom, and the little Love the Princeſs had for <hi>Caly,</hi> made him afaird <hi>Selim</hi> would not meet any conſiderable defence. He durſt not mention it in the leaſt to his Rival, leſt he ſhould not be able to maſter his confuſion in ſo ſubtile a point; reſerving himſelf therefore to be informed from the Princeſſes own mouth, he prepared himſelf for thoſe informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with inexpreſſible commotion. The deluded Lovers were in no leſs anxiety. Hope is an unquiet paſſion, which gives the mind more agitation many times, than a real deſpair. They propoſed the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to the Princeſſes at their return; they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved it, eſpecially <hi>Zuria,</hi> who finding the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the <hi>Derviſes</hi> not much differing from <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maels</hi> two Sons, had a violent imagination of the truth. She was got up and ready befor day, and preſſing <hi>Imerſelle</hi> to make as much haſte, they were got to the Grot before they were expected. Their new Lovers would accopany them by all means (which was foreſeen by the <hi>Derviſes</hi>) but they thought that obſtacle would be removed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they would ſhew them. They had ſhrowded themſelves each of them under a Hat with a long tail pulled down in ſuch ſort, it covered moſt of their faces. That kind of Dreſs they pretended, was the Habit of their Piety, when they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon any Conference with Women: <hi>Chaſan</hi> made ſigns to <hi>Imerſelle</hi> to follow him to the foot of a Rock, where he deſigned his Communication;
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:65131:180"/>and <hi>Caly</hi> took <hi>Zuria</hi> aſide to walk under the Trees; and that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince and his Camarade might give no interruption, they gave them certain pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language with injunction to go into the <hi>Grotto,</hi> and ſay them over there for their happy ſucceſs. The Rivals were flexible, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: They were ſo poſſeſt of the <hi>Derviſes</hi> Sanctity, they would have extended their conformity much further, if it had been deſired. <hi>Chaſan</hi> having pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Imerſelle</hi> upon a part of the Rock, which was covered with moſs, keeping himſelf juſt before her upon his feet, that the Sultans Equipage (who ſtood round about the Grot) might have no proſpect of his face. I have great things to relate to you, young Princeſs, ſaid he, diſſembling his voice as much as he could; I know things of you, you do not know of your ſelf; but as the ingenuous declaration of our moſt ſecret ſentiments is the ordinary Channel of Celeſtial graces, do you merit by that act of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion the good things which are in my power to impart; tell me ſincerely what was your thoughts of <hi>Seach Caly,</hi> what of <hi>Chaſan Helif,</hi> and what is your preſent opinion of the Sultan. Obſerving her to change colour, you are ſurpriſed, Princeſs, ſaid he, to find me ſo skilful in your affairs; but let me tell you, thoſe perſons who are honoured with a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Converſation with Heaven, are ignorant of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that paſſes upon Earth. I know you have a ſecret inclination to <hi>Chaſan;</hi> you diſcovered as much to <hi>Caly</hi> himſelf that night you were walking in the Palace Garden at <hi>Xiras,</hi> which, if my memory fails not, was the night before you were carried away; judge now if I be not acquainted with your
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:65131:180"/>affairs, and ſave me the labour of telling you any more. Alas! replied <hi>Imerſelle</hi> in a great ſurpriſe, I can ſay no more to you, having diſcovered my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for <hi>Chaſan,</hi> you have diſcovered the greateſt ſecret of my ſoul. I confeſs that Sympathy was born with me; yet when I thought it my duty to reſiſt it, I did it with ſome kind of ſucceſs, he never had the leaſt inclination of it from me, as you have had now: But if I muſt confeſs the true ſtate of my heart, I muſt acknowledge that inclination increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes every day upon me; I love <hi>Chaſan</hi> much better in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> than I did in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and by I know not what Capricio of Love, abſence augments that in me, which it deſtroys in all other perſons in the World. You have no kindneſs then for <hi>Selim?</hi> ſaid the happy <hi>Chaſan,</hi> and the Princeſs replying only with a contemptuous ſhrug, gave him more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction than an eloquent Diſcourſe. I am fully ſatisfied, fair Princeſs, of your ſincerity, ſaid <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> and to recompenſe it by an information as grateful, know <hi>Imerſelle,</hi> that <hi>Chaſan</hi> loves you a thouſand times better than you love him. It was he entertained you at the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Ball under the name of his Brother; it was he who leaving <hi>Caly</hi> with his Couſin <hi>Zuria</hi> that night you were walking in the Garden, appeaſed your indignation with thoſe mollifying words: To him it was you gave that Ring which ingaged your faith to him by thoſe ſacred proteſtations; and in a word, it is he who (renouncing all the pleaſures of his Fathers Court, and deſpiſing all the dangers he ſhould be expoſed to, were he known) ſpeaks to you at this preſent under the Name and Figure you ſee. The Prince
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:65131:181"/>might truſt <hi>Imerſelle</hi> without ſcruple, the confeſſion ſhe had made ſecured him againſt any indiſcretion. It was not without reaſon he had taken care the Princeſſes face ſhould be covered: the alterations this diſcourſe made there, could not have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt but by that precaution: She bluſht, ſhe was diſturbed, ſhe had like to have cryed out, and run away; but the danger the leaſt noiſe would bring upon <hi>Chaſan,</hi> reſtraining that <hi>impetus,</hi> ſhe remained as immoveable in the place where ſhe ſate: <hi>Chaſan</hi> taking advantage of her perplexity, drew out the Ring, and diſcovering his face, the Princeſs found ſo much Love there, that though her Eyes, and the ſight of her Ring had not convinced her, ſhe would have concluded no body but the counterfeit <hi>Egyptian,</hi> and he that made Love to her in the Walk, could have lookt upon her with ſuch paſſionate glances. She blamed the Prince for the perils to which he had expoſed himſelf, ſhe conjured him to clear himſelf as ſoon as he could, and then inquired very earneſtly how he had done to delude the Sultan and Prince <hi>Imerſe</hi> ſo handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He gave her an account in few words of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe askt him; he told her the Love <hi>Caly</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for <hi>Zuria,</hi> their adventures as Princes of <hi>Perſia,</hi> their adventures as <hi>Derviſes,</hi> and concluded all with a requeſt to her to cajol the imaginations of <hi>Selim,</hi> that by that Complacence perſwading him of the intereſts the <hi>Derviſes</hi> had in Heaven, he might be induced to permit the Princeſſes to viſit them oftner. The Converſation of <hi>Caly</hi> and <hi>Zuria</hi> was neither ſo ſerious, nor ſincere at firſt: ſhe knew the Prince as ſoon as ſhe ſee him, his ſhape, his
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:65131:181"/>voice, but above all the ſecret emotion of a heart truly affected, aſſured her it was none but her dear <hi>Caly</hi> that ſpoke to her; however reſolving to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him for that he had ſo well maſter'd his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: It was not neceſſary, devout Father, ſaid ſhe to him, that the Prince <hi>Imerſe</hi> ſhould bring me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the deſign he pretended; for whether by the miraculous efficacy of your prayers, or whether that there is a period for anger, as for other things; ſo it is, that ſenſible part of my heart which you promiſed to find, is perfectly diſcovered. I love the Prince of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and am ready to act whatever his Love can reaſonably expect from me. I am amazed, replied <hi>Caly</hi> in ſome kind of diſturbance, that this change ſhould be ſo ſudden; I have ſome ſecret Revelations which aſſured me that your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Prince <hi>Scach-Caly,</hi> would have made a better defence againſt the attaques of the Prince <hi>Imerſe.</hi> It did indeed make defence for a while, replied the ſly <hi>Zuria,</hi> and ſince you know all, I need not ſcruple to confeſs, I did love the Prince you ſpeak of very well; but the abſence of one Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the aſſiduities of another make ſtrange Metamorphoſes ſometimes in the affections of a Woman. The diſguiſed Prince began to rave at this diſcourſe, which made the Princeſs judg ſhe had carried her hypocriſie too far. She ſmiled, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Prince with an air ſufficient to deſpel a thouſand ſuſpicions; Recollect your ſelf, Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneur <hi>Dervis,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, you have but little Communication with Heaven, if you have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter notion of what happens below: Call in your good Genius to your relief, and ſhe will tell you
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:65131:182"/>
                  <hi>Zuria</hi> will never love any thing but her dear <hi>Caly,</hi> whom the diſguiſe of a <hi>Dervis</hi> cannot conceal from her heart, and that in all Habits, as in all places, he ſhall find her always the ſame. The Prince percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Errour by thoſe words, reproacht her a thouſand times for the perplexities ſhe had put him to: It was reſolved by agreement they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive as many Conferences as they could. He told her deſigns, which the proximity betwixt <hi>Imerſelle</hi> and <hi>Imerſe</hi> would not permit <hi>Chaſan</hi> to diſcover to that Princeſs; and then paſſing all of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to interrupt the two Lovers meditations in the Grot, the abuſed Princes found their prayers ſo effectual in appearance, they thought they could not ſufficiently admire the Celeſtial power wherewith the <hi>Derviſes</hi> were endued. The Princeſſes flattered their hopes with a thouſand frivolous aſſurances; <hi>Zurias</hi> greateſt care was to make peace betwixt <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Imerſe; Selim</hi> promiſed to diſpoſe hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:65131:182"/>with incomparable addreſs; they never fed but in the night, to perſwade ſuch as would be ſo ſimple, they kept perpetual faſt. The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince lookt upon them as ſent down from Heaven, and gave the Sultan his Father ſuch an Elogy of them, he ſent a perſon on purpoſe to viſit them from himſelf: They refuſed to ſee his Envoy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that was a day in which they were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to admit of any humane Converſation; and the Princeſſes themſelves coming to ſee them that day, were ſent back with the ſame excuſe. But it was not for nothing they denied themſelves ſo great a happineſs; they had ſeduced ſome of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Inhabitants of the Town of <hi>Antalia</hi> (which was the Reſidence of <hi>Caragoſe Beglierbey</hi> of <hi>Natolia</hi>) he had infuſed into them, that he had received a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Sword from Heaven, by vertue of which a new Government ſhould be eſtabliſhed in <hi>Turkie,</hi> that <hi>Bajazet</hi> was but an unprofitable Trunk, and that the crimes of <hi>Selim</hi> had provokt Heaven againſt his whole Race: The crimes wherewith he charged him, had been told from his own mouth, he declared them to the <hi>Natolians</hi> with advantage, and promiſing them no leſs than ineſtimable riches in this life, and eternal felicity in the next, if they aſſiſted towards the erection of that new Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they concurred, ingaged to receive him into their City, and take Arms under his Conduct to maintain the Sect of the <hi>Scaydars.</hi> This Treaty was managed in the moſt obſcure part of the Deſart, at the ſame time the <hi>Derviſes</hi> gave ſo great a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Sanctity, by refuſing <hi>Bajazets</hi> Envoy. The day ſet for the Enterpriſe, and all things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:65131:183"/>for its execution, they ſent word to Sultan <hi>Selim,</hi> that at length the moment was come in which the Divine Prophet commiſerating the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence they had done to themſelves in converſing ſo long among ſinners, had given them leave to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from that ſlavery, and retire into a Deſart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to all perſons affected with the pleaſures of this World, and that when they were once gone, they ſhould be heard of no more till they were dead, that before their departure they had obtained by ſingular favour a liberty of revealing all their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets to them effectually, which they had done hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto but in part; that if he pleaſed he might come to them to the Grot, and bring the two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes with him, to whom likewiſe they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the laſt pleaſure of their Prophet; but that they ſhould have as few of their Attendants as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, in reſpect of the horrour they conceived at the ſight of the people of this World. The Sultan ran head-long into the Trap he had laid for him; he went to the Grot with the Princeſſes, and Prince <hi>Imerſe,</hi> and not above eight or ten armed men in their Company. The <hi>Perſian</hi> Princes lay in Ambuſcade upon a paſs, at the head of three or four hundred new Sectaries, which they had divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ſeveral Squadrons, and diſpoſed privately up and down to prevent the danger of an Alarm, but with directions upon a Signal, agreed to draw into a Body, which they did, and fell upon the Sultan when he leaſt expected ſuch entertainment. The Princeſſes were ſecured, and carried away by their true Lovers to the City <hi>Antalia,</hi> where the Princes were received. They drove away the <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lierbey,</hi>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:65131:183"/>and put all that oppoſed to the Sword; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, they got ſo many men together, by their falſe predictions, and poſſeſt themſelves of ſo many Towns, that by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> they maintained War ſeveral years againſt all the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Oſman,</hi> and miſt narrowly of extinguiſhing them quite. They gained three great Battels, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led three <hi>Baſhaws,</hi> and which was more to their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, injoyed their Princeſſes quietly, whom the death of <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Imerſe,</hi> who lived not long after, left entirely to their diſpoſition.</p>

                  <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> being of too great Eminence and Quality to apprehend a repulſe, it was not long before he acquainted <hi>Xerina</hi> with his affections. The Princeſs approved of him well enough, and her ambition increaſed her approbation. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the declaration of his Love without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and promiſing <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> to turn Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as he promiſed to relinquiſh the Princeſs of <hi>Portugal;</hi> Love was ſo witty as to prevent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe for his inconſtancy, by perſwading him he did a meritorious act in quitting his firſt Miſtreſs,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:65131:184"/>to make his ſecond a Proſelyte: and thus were theſe new Lovers united in a quiet and firm union. <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> intruſted <hi>Xerina</hi> with his moſt ſecret thoughts, and the Princeſs to recompenſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, ſhewed him all the kindneſs imaginable: In this poſture they lived whilſt the War was in ſuſpence; but <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> having forced <hi>Muley</hi> to a Battel in the Plains of <hi>Tamiſta,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> were ſlain, and with them ſo great a number of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nobleſs, there was ſcarce one left to return with the ſad news. <hi>Xerina</hi> loſing at that defeat the Crowns of <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Fez,</hi> and her hopes of <hi>Portugal</hi> with them, was tranſported with a moſt inconſolable ſorrow: A little before day ſhe ran her ſelf into the Plain of <hi>Tamiſta</hi> (attended by only one Chriſtian Slave cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Laura,</hi> who was privy to all her ſecrets) reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with her own hands to have ſacrificed her ſelf upon the Corps of her beloved King; ſhe ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him among the diſmal numbers of the dead and the dying, with which that Plain was covered at that time. Some of the wounded who had yet ſo much ſenſe left them as to know her, directed her to that part of the Battel where he fought; ſhe ran thither with great fury, and ſuppoſing ſhe had met with her Monarch in the perſon of a young <hi>Portuguez,</hi> who reſembled him very much, ſhe fetcht a ſad ſhreek, and prepared her ſelf to execute her dire reſolution; but the poor man opening his eyes at her Cry, and it being by that time clear day, ſhe perceived he was not dead. From an unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable ſorrow, ſhe paſt to ſo immoderate a joy, it had almoſt coſt her her life, but recollecting her
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:65131:185"/>ſelf, and calling <hi>Laura</hi> to her aſſiſtance, her Love re-inforced her natural ſtrength ſo well, ſhe drew her beloved from amongſt the dead, and haled him to the Bank of the River <hi>Mucazen,</hi> which runs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by the Plain where the Battel was fought: Having got him ſo far, ſhe examined his wounds, bound them up as well as ſhe could, and ſending <hi>Laura</hi> to a houſe ſhe diſcryed not far from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſhe cauſed people to come and help to carry him to ſome place of ſecurity. Indeed there were but few of that Nature in that Kingdom, for the ſucceſs of that Battel gave <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> poſſeſſion of all his pretenſions, and the Engagement of <hi>Don Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian</hi> with his Enemy <hi>Muley,</hi> rendred his death ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to that new Kings repoſe; <hi>Xerina</hi> was as well fearful of the life of her Lover, as of his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if he fell into the hands of the Conqueror. She put him therefore into a Bark, and rowing down with him to the mouth of the River (which was not very far) ſhe landed him in a little Iſland where there were ſome few habitations. She had many Jewels about her; the Ladies of her Quality among the <hi>Mores,</hi> are uſually covered with them; ſhe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed ſome of them amongſt thoſe who had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, and conjuring them to fetch her Chirurgions from ſome of the neighbouring Towns, they brought her ſuch relief as his condition required. His wounds being ſearcht, were not found to be dangerous, their greateſt apprehenſion was from his great loſs of blood; the ſight of what was done for him, ſurpriſed him exceedingly, he ſaw himſelf lamented, and relieved by one of the faireſt perſons in the World, whoſe Quality was proclaimed by
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:65131:185"/>her Habit, but could not ſatisfie himſelf for what reaſon a Lady he had never ſeen before to his knowledge, ſhould concern her ſelf ſo far in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. He would have inquired, but ſhe ſtopt his mouth, telling him in <hi>Portugueſe</hi> (which ſhe had learnt to pleaſe <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi>) that he was not yet ſtrong enough for a diſcourſe, and that ſhe would give him an account of all when his health did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. Theſe cares augmented his aſtoniſhment more and more, and he called out many times to have his Deſtiny cleared. The firſt moment it might be done without danger, <hi>Xerina</hi> ſate down by his Pillow, and told him; At length, Sir, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to conceive hopes of your recovery; the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens would not deprive the <hi>Portugals</hi> of their King, and have been pleaſed to make uſe of the Miniſtry of your <hi>Xerina,</hi> for the preſervation of the life of her dear <hi>Don Sebaſtian.</hi> The wounded perſon found the Princeſſes miſtake by her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but thought it no prudence to convert her, on the contrary he uſed all his Art to confirm it: he foreſaw too many good conſequences, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage them ill. He returned a thouſand paſſionate acknowledgments to the Princeſs, and conjured her to tell him which way it was poſſible ſhe ſhould get him off the field. She gave him an account, and by that account he diſcovered <hi>Xerinas</hi> Birth, and ingagements with the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> He did his utmoſt to perſonate <hi>Don Sebaſtian;</hi> and he might do it the more ſecurely, becauſe the people whom <hi>Xerina</hi> had ſent out in queſt of <hi>Don Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> had brought her word, that endeavouring to ſave himſelf by ſwimming the River, he was
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:65131:186"/>drowned, and his body not to be found. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved this truth to be an errour, as confidently as her own errour to be a truth; and promiſing no leſs to her ſelf than in a ſhort time to be made Queen of <hi>Portugal,</hi> there was no care, nor no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe but (in her opinion) ſhe ought to ſo juſt a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion. The wounded <hi>Portugal</hi> had Courage and Wit enough to make his advantage of his Fortune. He learnt by the Princeſſes diſcourſe, that <hi>Muley Boabdelin,</hi> a Prince of the Blood Royal of <hi>Morocco,</hi> had had particular friendſhip with the true King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> She cauſed advertiſement to be ſent to him, that her Friend <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> was not dead according to Report, but that if he pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the Iſle of <hi>Mucazen,</hi> he ſhould hear further. <hi>Muley</hi> departed with all ſpeed from the remoteſt part of the Province of <hi>Hoſcore</hi> (whither he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from the Tyranny of <hi>Abdelmelec</hi>) and cauſing himſelf to be conducted by <hi>Xerinas</hi> Envoy, to the place where he aſſured he ſhould find him, he was deceived by the reſemblance, as <hi>Xerina</hi> had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. In the Hiſtories of all Ages and all Countries, there is nothing more ſtrange than the perfection of this reſemblance: It extended even to the natural marks <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> had in certain places of his body. <hi>Muley</hi> not doubting therefore but the perſon he ſaw was the true King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> he expreſt extreme joy at his preſervation, and acquainted him that his Uncle <hi>Henry,</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and Brother to <hi>Don John</hi> who died laſt, was by the conſent of the people, choſen to ſucceed him. This news ſtartled the ambition of our counterfeit <hi>Sebaſtian;</hi> he was afraid it would be no
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:65131:186"/>eaſie matter to diſpoſſeſs <hi>Henry</hi> of a Throne he was eſtabliſht in already; <hi>Muley</hi> was of his opinion: it was agreed they ſhould negotiate with ſome of the principal of that Kingdom, to aſſert the Intereſt of their Monarch, and not ſuffer it to be invaded by the artifice of an upſtart King. <hi>Muley</hi> offered <hi>Xerina</hi> and her Lover a retreat in the mean time into his Province of <hi>Hoſcore,</hi> where he was too well fortified to apprehend a purſuit. They concluded amongſt them, that it ſhould not be publiſht <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> was alive, till he ſhould be in a condition to be reſtored to the Crown; but to authorize what kindneſs the Princeſs had ſhown him, <hi>Muley</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them that above all things it would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for him to marry <hi>Xerina</hi> immediately. This was one of the effects of that reſemblance of which the falſe <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> hoped to reap the benefit. He was inamour'd of the Princeſſes Beauty and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: he ſatisfied <hi>Muley</hi>'s deſires with as much joy as readineſs, and till his poſſeſſion had maſter'd his appetite, reckoned himſelf among the happieſt of his Sex; but when once he was married, and had quencht the ardour of his deſires, the private Negotiation in <hi>Portugal</hi> began to go on but ſlowly; no body was vigorous enough in his affairs, and nothing would ſerve but he muſt go over, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage them himſelf. Poor <hi>Xerina</hi> diſſwaded him from that reſolution with the moſt fervent Careſſes Love could poſſibly inſpire: I love you as well without your Crown, ſaid ſhe to him, as with it, and why then is it neceſſary? let it be your felicity to be beloved by me, as it is mine to be beloved by you, and you will have no need of ſuch hazardous
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:65131:187"/>deſires. Why! Madam, replied the falſe Monarch, do you think it poſſible for a Prince born to wear a Crown, and who hath already taſted the ſweetneſs of Dominion, to condeſcend and debaſe himſelf to the condition of a private perſon? Ha! Madam, either you have not conſidered what it is to be a King, or you have not any regard to my ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſeeing the Propoſitions you make, are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable to me. Pardon, Sir, what is paſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Xerina,</hi> and I ſhall diſoblige you no more in that nature; I muſt acknowledge your ſoul to be too large to be bounded with ordinary imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: But let mine have the ſame Juſtice, ſuffer me to contribute my aſſiſtance towards the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of your Crown, and vouchſafe me my ſhare in all the difficulties you ſhall meet. <hi>Africa, Aſia, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and all places are alike to me in your Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, refuſe me not then that pleaſure of following you, which you owe to my Love; and were I ſo unhappy to find any thing more potent upon your ſoul than that paſſion, yet it ought to be my glory to cooperate towards the eſtabliſhment of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to which you have no pretenſion but for me. Theſe kind conſiderations paſt for reproaches in the Spirit of the diſguſted <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended therewith, and his Capricio provokt <hi>Xerina</hi> as much. They fell into ſome extravagant expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and thoſe pretences furniſht him with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired pretence. <hi>Xerina</hi> had news he was preparing for <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſhe made Verſes to diſſwade him ſo kind and importunate, nothing but a ſatiated Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could have read them without being moved. He ſcarce vouchſafed to caſt an eye upon them, and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:65131:187"/>ſome of them were not opened till he came into <hi>Portugal.</hi> He had found Love ſo favourable to him in <hi>Africk,</hi> he preſumed it would be his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor in all his other Enterpriſes. He underſtood the ſecrets of <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> as well as he had been he; That Prince had diſcovered all to <hi>Xerina,</hi> and this falſe <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> had wheedled them artificially out of the Princeſs, in pretending to take delight in the relations ſhe made of the expreſſions of his Love. Tell me I beſeech you, Madam, ſaid he, what was it you were moſt affected with in all my proceedings, I would willingly know what it was ſatisfied you moſt, that I might do the ſame thing often, which I did before with ſuch ſucceſs. The Princeſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly confeſſed the thing by which ſhe thought her ſelf moſt obliged, was his deſertion of <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and that the rather, ſaid ſhe, becauſe that Princeſs is fair, loved you very well, and (as you told me your ſelf) was beloved entirely by you, before your acquaintance with me: And, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, the ſecrets of State which I imparted to you, replied the Impoſtor, were not you well pleaſed with them; that piece of confidence is the higheſt and moſt obliging a Monarch can expreſs. <hi>Xerina</hi> acknowledged her ingagement for them alſo; and then falling into a recapitulation of whatever <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> had told her (that was of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) ſhe diſcovered to her falſe Prince all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of that State. Furniſht with a precaution ſo neceſſary, he took his Journey for <hi>Italy,</hi> as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Princeſs of <hi>Portugal</hi> contracted to <hi>Don Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian,</hi> was married ſince his death to <hi>Alexander Farneſe,</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and was at that time a
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:65131:188"/>Widow. Perſons of the Quality he pretended are not ignorant of thoſe kind of affairs. He arrived at <hi>Parma,</hi> and having cauſed the Dutcheſs to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, there was a <hi>Portugal</hi> Gentleman which had brought her tidings he could not communicate to any but her ſelf, he was by her order introduced into her Cloſet. By an Expreſs from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> ſhe had lately received news that Cardinal <hi>Henry</hi> was dead; and was preparing her Claim to the Crown for <hi>Ranuccio Farneſe</hi> her Son, who being by the Mother ſide deſcended from Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Original from <hi>Emanuel,</hi> the Chief of that Royal Line. Several other Pretenders did the ſame: <hi>Catharine,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Mary,</hi> ſet up the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>Theodor de Braganza</hi> her Son: <hi>Emanuel Philbert,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> pretended to it in right of his Mother <hi>Beatrix</hi> of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and ſo large was the Competition, <hi>Catharine de Medicis</hi> (though of a Branch far remoter than the reſt) was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her Claim; but above all <hi>Paul</hi> IV. was moſt ſollicitous, pretending that Crown to be a Fief to the Papal See, and endeavouring zealouſly in his own perſon to defeat the pretences of his Competitors. To regulate ſo great a difference, the States of that Kingdom were conven'd; and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Parma</hi> having her head full of thoſe affairs, lookt upon her falſe <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> as the Ghoſt of her true one, came on purpoſe at that time to direct her in her diſtractions. She fetcht a great skreek as ſoon as ſhe ſaw him, and running to the other end of the Cloſet in an amaze, ſhe told her new King ſhe took him for a Spirit. How! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid he without any viſible commotion, does
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:65131:188"/>
                  <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> fright you? he expected a better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception for the pains he hath ſuffered coming in to ſee you. The Dutcheſſes trouble increaſed at the hearing of his voice, ſo as ſhe could neither ſpeak, nor ſtir out of her place. Dear Couſin, continued her falſe <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> in a moſt paſſionate tone, I am no Phantoſm, I am the ſame <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly honoured with your favour, and I am return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as full of your fair Idea, as when I went firſt into <hi>Africk.</hi> The Dutcheſs recovered her ſelf a little, and permitting <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> to come nearer, ſhe put forth her hand, though tremblingly, towards the hand of the Monarch, ſhe toucht him, ſhe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him, and her ſenſes aſſured her that what ſhe ſaw and what ſhe felt, was certainly <hi>Don Sebaſtian.</hi> Ha! Sir, ſaid ſhe with a moſt pitiful voice, whence do you come? where have you hid your ſelf thus long? by what miracle are you returned? When you ſhall be in a condition to hear me, replied <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian,</hi> I will give you an account; in the mean time recollect your ſelf from your fright, believe me the real King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and if you do not know me by my ſhape, my voice, or the features of my face, at leaſt owne me by the impreſſion of Love you cannot but diſcover in my Eyes. I am fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected, replied the Dutcheſs, calling for a Chair for him, and ſitting by him her ſelf: I confeſs the firſt ſight of you put me into a confuſion I could not ſuddenly maſter; but now, Sir, it is diſſipated, and gone. Tell me therefore I beſeech you, and do not delay me, to what miracle is it we owe both your life, and return. To love, Madam, replied <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> a paſſion that was able to affect your
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:65131:189"/>heart, could not be leſs favourable than to defend me againſt all other accidents. Then he gave her a relation how he had been taken from amongſt the dead by <hi>Xerina,</hi> how for ſome time he had continued in the Iſle of <hi>Mucazen,</hi> and afterwards in <hi>Hoſcore;</hi> but he concealed very carefully from the Dutcheſs, that ever <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> was in Love with <hi>Xerina</hi> before the Battel. He told her that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was in Love with him indeed, but without any expectation. I had no inclination in the world to have her ſo much as think ſo, continued he, for having paſt my Parole to you, I would have dyed before I would have broken it. He told her that by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Muley Boabdelin,</hi> a Prince of the Royal Blood of <hi>Morocco, Xerina</hi> had given him all imaginable perſecution, to force him to a relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhment of her, that ſhe had urged to him her Marriage with the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and preſt him very hard to a repriſal, but that underſtanding a while after, ſhe was a Widow, he had eſcapt out of Priſon, and was come to throw that Prince at her feet, who had not only loved her always himſelf, but flattered himſelf with the thoughts of being beloved by her. The Dutcheſs demanded, if he loved her ſo well, why he never writ to her? I writ ſeveral times, Madam, replied he, but <hi>Xerina</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt (who expected that from my ruine, which ſhe could not hope from my reſtabliſhment) took ſuch Orders to intercept them, as never any of them could come to your hand. My Captivity was very ſevere, I was treated like one that was beloved, but could get no liberty to free my ſelf from the trouble of that Character. The Dutcheſs
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:65131:189"/>of <hi>Parma</hi> overjoy'd with the relation of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy ſo well repreſented, made as many excuſes as Congies to her miſtaken Couſin. She appointed him an Appartment according to his ſuppoſed Quality; aſſigned him a ſuitable Equipage, and furniſht him with grave men to ſend as his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the Eſtates of <hi>Portugal.</hi> That Deputation cauſed a ſtrange ſurpriſe, as may be imagined. They ſelected ſix out of their Aſſembly, ſome of which had been Miniſters to <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> and ſent them into <hi>Italy,</hi> to ſurvey their dear Monarch: their Eyes perſwaded them it was he; but not daring to relye wholly upon them, they askt him certain queſtions they would have ſworn none but the right <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> could have anſwered. But he was throughly inſtructed by <hi>Xerina;</hi> Love had tranſported the ſoul of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> into that of the Princeſs of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and by an effect of the ſame Love, the ſoul of <hi>Xerina</hi> was tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the falſe <hi>Sebaſtian.</hi> The Ambaſſadors (convinced that no man living could have reſolved thoſe queſtions but the true <hi>Sebaſtian</hi>) made their Report to the Eſtates, he was undoubtedly their King: The Competitors accuſed them of Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, proteſted they were corrupt, and demanded that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> might appear in perſon at the Aſſembly of the States General, to be formally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogated before them. Such as were affected to the memory of <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded it could be done with ſecurity to him: the Aſſembly was divided; ſuch as were for the King, were called Royaliſts; ſuch as were for the Princes, were called the League. During which diſorders,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:65131:190"/>he that was the cauſe of them, had his Reſidence at <hi>Parma,</hi> attending till there ſhould be an Army rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to vindicate his intereſt, at the Head of which he reſolved to demand Reſtauration. He ought his life to <hi>Xerina;</hi> he was loved entirely by her, and had loved her as well: But the Princeſs of <hi>Parma</hi> ingaged the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> in his quarrel, and when the deſign of being King interpoſes in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, reaſon of State rules the roaſt, and leaves all others in the lurch: He ſacrificed his gratitude to his ambition without any remorſe, and imploying thoſe Leſſons of kindneſs he had received from <hi>Xerina,</hi> againſt her ſelf, he made them the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that Complacence and artifice, to which the heart of the Dutcheſs was forced to ſubmit. She loved him for his perſon, much more for his quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſhe began to be jealous without knowing any reaſonable grounds for her jealouſie; ſuch paſſions as hers are ſeldom without great curioſity. One evening when her counterfeit <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> was leading her by the ſide of a Canal, which is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Ornaments to the Palace of <hi>Farneſe,</hi> ſhe ſpied a Ribband hanging out of his Pocket, which ſhe judged might be one of thoſe Letter-caſes called in <hi>Italy Cartero's;</hi> ſhe ſtole it out gently, and having conveyed it into her own Pocket, without being perceived, ſhe began to be impatient to be peeping. She could not have had any thing more proper to have juſtified her ſecret ſuſpicions, than that. It was a parcel of <hi>Xerinas</hi> Letters and Verſes, which the falſe <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> had found that morning (in a little Cabinet he brought with him out of <hi>Africk</hi>) and had put them in his Pocket with reſolution to
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65131:190"/>have burnt them, but he was interrupted by the coming in of the Dutcheſs; and this Walk having followed immediately upon the Viſit, he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to keep them in his Pocket, till the curious Dutcheſs thought good to remove them. She read two or three Notes at firſt, which ſeemed to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but aſſurances of the Sacrifice her Monarch pretended to have made to her, of the affections of <hi>Xerina.</hi> That Princeſs had complained of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of his Love, and reproacht him by his infidelity: But ſhe not having had always reaſon to complain, there were Letters of his, recrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon her. They were all writ in <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> but one among the reſt was ſealed up, which the tender <hi>Xerina</hi> had ſent to her Ingrate, ſome few days before his departure from <hi>Hoſcore,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Paper of Verſes upon their late difference, ſo ſenſible and kind, I could not but inſert them.</p>

                  <l>Is it decreed then, and pronounc'd above?</l>

               </q>
               <p>All this ſhall do you no good, cryed the Dutcheſs of <hi>Parma;</hi> when ſhe had read them through, I
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:65131:191"/>ſhall take ſuch Orders, your hopes ſhall evaporate. But alas! ſaid ſhe (caſting her Eyes upon ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as gave the ſtrongeſt inſinuations of <hi>Xerinas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beloved) I fear it is too late; and reading them again, ſhe ſtopt when ſhe came at theſe.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>In vain I ſeek thee now in places where</l>
                  <l>So oft, in Love to me, thou didſt appear.</l>
               </q>
               <p>This, ſaid ſhe, is not the expreſſion of a deſpiſed Lover; if it be true thou art ſo now, it is no leſs true, that thou haſt not been ſo always; that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration repreſenting <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> light, and unconſtant, and apprehending the ſame levity of which ſhe ſaw ſuch fatal marks in the Princeſs of <hi>Morocco,</hi> ſhe ſuffered her ſelf to be ſurpriſed by the moſt violent fit of ſorrow, ſhe had ever been ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of in her life. As ſhe was in the midſt of theſe melancholy reflexions, her falſe <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into her Chamber, he had perceived he had loſt his Letters; and ſuſpecting what had really happened, was come to make his Apology. The firſt thing he ſaw when he came in, was <hi>Xerinas</hi> Letters upon the Table, and the Paper of Verſes on the top, and clapping his hand upon them, Your charity ſure is very ſmall, Madam, ſaid he to the Dutcheſs, to expoſe the follies of a Princeſs, whoſe Quality and Innocence deſerved more compaſſion: Conceal her extravagances, I beſeech you, Madam, I am much troubled they ſhould fall into your hands, I put them into my Pocket, with deſign to have burnt them, and kept them not only from your Eyes, but from the ſight of the whole World.
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:65131:192"/>They have not been always ſo odious to you, Sir, replied the Dutcheſs, and if I may conjecture from them, I owe that to your Highneſs, which I aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed before to your conſtancy; 'tis not to the Love of me, you ſacrifice the Princeſs of <hi>Morocco,</hi> 'tis to the fickleneſs of that which you pretended to her; and then ſhewing him the Verſes ſhe had markt, Read, Sir, ſaid ſhe, read here in what manner <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina</hi> expreſſes her ſelf, and then vouchſafe to tell me how your return is to be called. The Verſes were exceeding tender and kind, and muſt needs renew the impreſſions of ſenſibility in a heart which had been ſenſible before; but nothing is ſo obdurately impenetrable as the heart which follows after a violent paſſion. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> concerned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not one jot at what <hi>Xerina</hi> had written; but applying his thoughts wholly to pacifie the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs: I never loved the Princeſs of <hi>Morocco</hi> in my life, Madam, ſaid he to her; if ſhe fancied ſo her ſelf, and that imagination brake into theſe Verſes, it is but a vanity common to the greateſt part of her Sex, to which I have contributed no more than by an indiſpenſable Civility. But, Madam, in the caſe of your Marriage with the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> it is not poſſible for me to flatter my ſelf with that opinion, 'tis a thing palpable and conſtant, and can never be excuſed. Do not you upbraid me by my Marriage, to juſtifie your own Levity, replied the Dutcheſs: Women of my Quality are ſubject to ſuch Formalities, as no paſſion can exempt us from. I believed you to be dead, and all <hi>Portugal</hi> bear me witneſs I never ſaw Duke <hi>Alexander</hi> till I married him: But you, Sir, knew I was alive, you knew
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:65131:192"/>where to addreſs your ſelf; yet you did that by Election, which I did out of obedience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; and if your heart hath been toucht for <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi> you are guilty not only of one ſingle act, but of a habit of infidelity. <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> did what he could to expunge that fancy out of her mind; he endeavoured to perſwade the Dutcheſs, that if people be found at their return, as they were when they departed, they ought never to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned about the interval. The Dutcheſs did not reliſh that Doctrine, ſhe proceeded in her Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, multiplying her Chimera's, till at laſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie all, <hi>Xerina</hi> arrived at <hi>Lisbon.</hi> This Princeſs receiving no tokens of her Servants remembrance, and underſtanding by report how things proceeded in <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſhe obtained liberty of <hi>Muley</hi> to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her ſelf to clear up thoſe doubts which the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguez</hi> lay under: And indeed ſhe did clear them; but (in giving her reaſons (which ſeemed to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory) that the falſe was the true <hi>Sebaſtian</hi>) ſhe diſcovered withal, that her mighty Monarch was married to her. It was happy for him he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Parma</hi> when theſe tidings arrived; had he been there, the fury of the Dutcheſs would too probably have found out ſome fatal way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; but by good luck he was gone to head thoſe Troops his Friends had raiſed for the aſſertion of his intereſt. <hi>Xerinas</hi> Title was indiſputable; ſhe was contracted to <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> by the King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> before the Battel of <hi>Tamiſta;</hi> it was not to his gratitude to <hi>Xerina</hi> only the Dutcheſs of <hi>Parma</hi> ought to attribute his Treaſon, for he had loved her Rival before ſhe had ſaved his life; and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:65131:193"/>he which ſhe miſtook for <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> had married her afterward in the Province of <hi>Hoſcore,</hi> with all requiſite Formalities; nor could the difference of their Religions be any obſtruction, for <hi>Xerina</hi> had promiſed to turn Chriſtian, and performed, as ſoon as ſhe was landed in <hi>Portugal.</hi> How could the Dutcheſs of <hi>Parma</hi>'s fury be expreſt when ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood all theſe circumſtances? Had he had but one fault to have been pardoned, 'tis poſſible Love might have obtained it: But all ways of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation were interdicted; and that which rendred her indignation moſt juſt, was, that this falſe <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> had received a thouſand innocent favours from her, which this unlucky news converted into crimes. Love effected that in her which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in moſt of her Sex; ſhe ran from one extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to another, and her anger being augmented by the conſideration of her paſt kindneſs, ſhe ſent on purpoſe to the States of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to remonſtrate that her new <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> was an Impoſtor, that ſhe had diſcovered it by ſeveral contradictions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe had ſurpriſed him; and pretending a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age into <hi>Portugal,</hi> with deſign to procure that Crown for the young <hi>Farneſe,</hi> her Son, ſhe came in perſon to <hi>Lisbon</hi> to incite Enemies againſt that Traitor. Her fury was better ſighted than her Love; for 'tis clear, he demanded a Crown to which he could make no pretence: but the Dutcheſs acted not upon that foundation, it was Jealouſie alone which infuſed her revenge; and as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt motive to her animoſity, ſhe found the Princeſs of <hi>Morocco</hi> ſo exquiſitely beautiful, ſhe could not but excuſe in private that crime, which publickly ſhe
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:65131:193"/>endeavoured to puniſh. This conſideration exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her the more; ſhe was in a rage, becauſe ſhe had no more reaſon to be ſo. The Princeſs of <hi>Morocco</hi> diſcovered all her confuſions; and being together one day, I ſee, Madam, ſaid ſhe to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Parma,</hi> you will not have <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> true King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> becauſe he cannot make you partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of the Crown; but, Madam, I will expiate the infidelity wherewith you charge him, by giving you the true Character of my Soul. Imploy your intereſt to reſtore him, retract thoſe reproaches your unjuſt reſentment hath diffuſed, and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Prince ſhall perform that promiſe he made to you formerly; for I had rather ſee him in the Throne, and flatter my ſelf in private, that owing me his life and his Crown, he loves me at his heart better than her who would deprive him, then to poſſeſs it quietly my ſelf, and apprehend whilſt he is even in my arms, his inclinations are ſomewhere elſe. Theſe generous reſolutions being by publick Fame carried into his Camp, the falſe <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> could not but reſume in ſome meaſure that Love which his ambition had expelled. He was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with his confederate Troops to that part of the Frontier which ſeparates <hi>Portugal</hi> from the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Oviedo:</hi> he was forced to an Ingagement at that paſs, where fighting to make <hi>Xerina</hi> Queen, as well as himſelf King, his zeal made his Valour ſo inconſiderate, he was taken Priſoner in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; and being conducted to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſcourſed of among his Competitors but chaſtiſing his temerity by ſome ignominious pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: The defeat of <hi>Tanniſta</hi> had not been
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:65131:194"/>ſo mortal, but there remained ſome conſiderable perſons who could give an account of the deſtiny of their King; all of them affirmed they had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him to the River <hi>Mucazen;</hi> ſome that they ſaw him drowned, and ſome that they ran great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of the ſame Fate, in endeavouring to ſave him. This report was nor according to what <hi>Xerina</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; ſhe had found her pretended <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> in the midſt of the Battel; and that which made moſt againſt him, was, that the habit by which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs deſcribed him, did not agree with what the <hi>Portugal</hi> Officers aſſured he had on that day. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs Nature had been pleaſed to put ſuch a reſemblance betwixt them, and it was ſeconded ſo well by their Wit and their Courage, it was not known which way to reſolve; the more this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent was examined, the more intricate it appeared. To deny the Crown to their lawful Prince, was an unpardonable offence; to proſtitute it, on the other ſide, to an Impoſtor, was no leſs unjuſtifiable. But death fixt their reſolutions; for whether Policy of State lookt upon <hi>Don Sebaſtians</hi> Alliance with the <hi>Mores</hi> as dangerous to that Kingdom; or that the Dutcheſs of <hi>Parma</hi> perceiving the States inclining to <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> found out ſome unlawful way of preventing the Triumph of her Rival, ſo it was the counterfeit King dyed in Priſon, and left no ſmall ſuſpicion that his death was unnatural. 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported before he expired, he deſired to ſpeak with <hi>Xerina,</hi> and (the laſt moment being an admirable Touch-ſtone to try the jugglings of a mans life) he declared to the Princeſs of <hi>Morocco</hi> (as is reported) that he was not King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and conjured her
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:65131:194"/>not to enterpriſe any thing againſt him whom they ſhould chuſe after he was deceaſed. This Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was no more than what was neceſſary, for <hi>Xerina</hi> had a Son by him, who would have been the occaſion of very great diſorders, nor could he do all this without great teſtimony of remorſe: 'Tis not one way alone, Madam, ſaid he to the Princeſs, in which I have deceived you; for that part of my fallacy, which made me your Husband, I reproach my ſelf not much, I ſhould have blamed my ſelf much more (had I neglected it, being in my power as it was) than I think my ſelf culpable, in accepting that honour: But, Madam, that which ſticks cloſeſt, and gives me greateſt regret, is, that for ſome time I have diſcontinued my affection, and (in hopes of a Crown which I never obtained, and which by a thouſand accidents might have been raviſht from me, if I had) have forſaken a heart all the Crowns in the World were not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence. Do not afflict your ſelf with unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary compunction, replied the generous Princeſs, I loved the perſon of my <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> above the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which ſurrounded him: I thought to have found his perſon in you, and thoſe Charms where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I was ſurpriſed, loſt nothing of their Energy for not proceeding from a King. I confeſs I ſhould not have obſerved them in an ordinary perſon, my Spirit and my Birth would not have permitted to have fixt my Eyes upon any leſs than a King. But at length I became delighted with my errour, for to a vertuous Woman the name of a Husband is ſo ſacred, it wipes away all ſpots that can poſſibly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it. Let us ſtrive to overcome your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:65131:195"/>my dear Prince? Pardon me, Fortune, for giving him that Title, ſaid ſhe with her Eyes up to Heaven, thou oughteſt to have given it, though thou didſt not; and then turning again to her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, ſhe cryed, Force your ſelf, dear Sir, out of the jaws of death, if it be poſſible, perhaps our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny may be kinder in <hi>Africk</hi> than in <hi>Portugal.</hi> The ſuppoſed Prince was ſo ſtrangely affected with this exceſs of Generoſity, his very tranſport was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to have killed him: He expired in the Arms of his over-paſſionate <hi>Xerina,</hi> and her ſoul was in no ſmall danger of bearing his company. This man had abuſed her by a deceit inſupportable to the Quality of a Princeſs, and his ſubſequent inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was more offenſive than the other; but <hi>Xerina</hi> had loved him entirely, and (let vindicative Ladies ſay what they pleaſe) that perſon is never hated, which was beloved heartily before. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of their Stars, they abominate their Influence, and hate themſelves many times for having ſo little diſcretion; but this hatred indeed, is but a Copy of their Countenance, and never goes ſo deep as they would ſeem to pretend: The Ideas of a man who hath been perfectly beloved, ought always to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred: No reſentment can attaque them without Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge; and if any fury could be found ſo violent, as to violate that Law, ſhe never was capable of true affection, ſhe loved to ſatisfie her own appetite, and not only for Love, <hi>Xerina</hi> obſerved the laſt orders of her counterfeit <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> with exceeding punctuality, as ſoon as her ſorrow permitted, ſhe retired into <hi>Africk,</hi> and gave not the leaſt oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Theodore Braganza,</hi> who was elected King
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:65131:195"/>of <hi>Portugal.</hi> I do not think the Reader requires further light in this Adventure, I have inlarged it much to what it is repreſented in my Hiſtory, and I aſſure my ſelf there are many who believe they have peruſed all the Memoires of that Age, to whom this Princeſs of <hi>Morocco</hi> is every where a ſtranger, except in the Annals of Love.</p>

                  <hi>MAhomet</hi> III. had three Sons by three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sultaneſſes: <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> whom he cauſed to be ſlain in his own time; <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caya,</hi> whoſe Hiſtory I am writing; and <hi>Achmet,</hi> who ſucceeded his Father in the Empire: <hi>Jacaya</hi>'s Mother was a Chriſtian; the Magnificences of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> were not able to eradicate the ſentiments of her Religion. She pretended her ſelf ſick, and a Phyſician, indulging her deſigns, adviſed her for
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:65131:196"/>change of Air to remove to <hi>Magneſia.</hi> She obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leave to carry her Son along with her, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſperſed it abroad, that he dyed of the ſmall Pox (which had raged violently about that time) ſhe cauſed another to be buried publickly in his ſtead, and committed the care of her Son to an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, one of her Confidents. The Eunuch tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him to <hi>Greece,</hi> and recommended him to the Tuition of the Biſhop of <hi>Theſſalonia:</hi> The good Biſhop baptized him, and gave him careful Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till he was fifteen or ſixteen years old. At that age the Eunuch, who was privy to the Myſtery of his Affairs, had a great deſire to impart them to him. The weight of a ſecret is too ponderous for perſons of his Character; and to ſpeak Poetically, would have been a troubleſom bundle in the Ferry-Boat of <hi>Charon.</hi> See then the Prince informed of his Extraction, and very deſirous to know what they talkt of him in the World. He diſguiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a <hi>Dervis,</hi> and ſtealing from the Tutelage of his Biſhop, he directed his Courſe privately to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the chief Cities in <hi>Greece.</hi> Many people were offended at the prematurity of his Profeſſion, and believing him what his Habit repreſented, 'Tis pity, ſaid the Ladies, this young man ſhould have been ſo early devoted to Heaven. Being arrived at <hi>Scopea,</hi> he underſtood the death of his Father; he knew likewiſe that <hi>Muſtapha</hi> being out of the World, the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Crown would have fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his head, had not the falſe news of his death di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted it upon his younger Brother. His Mothers zeal to preſerve him, began then to appear indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet: He was of an age in which they are more
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:65131:197"/>ſenſible of earthly than celeſtial Dignity. He paſt into <hi>Aſia,</hi> where his Intelligence told him certain <hi>Baſhaws</hi> were in Revolt againſt their new Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: He diſcovered himſelf to be the Son of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> put himſelf in the Head of their rebellious Troops, and marcht againſt <hi>Achmets</hi> Lieutenants. A Romantick Author would not fail to have made him conquer his Enemy, and given the Empire to the Exploits of his victorious Arm; and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, for right being on his ſide, why ſhould Fortune be againſt him? however he performed what a man of Courage could poſſibly do in defence of his Title; but in deſpight of his Bravery and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, he was wounded, defeated, and had much ado to eſcape the purſuit of his Enemies; I take the liberty notwithſtanding to inlarge, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſe his Adventures with ſuch Accidents as are leaſt incompatible with the Hiſtory. Though this reverſe of Fortune was a moſt ſenſible affliction to our young Sultan, it did not quite ruine his hopes. Right of Blood never wants Protectors, no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom being ſo empty of ſeditious and turbulent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but there will always be ſome will embrace with both Arms the pretence of a Revolt, if guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the leaſt appearance of Juſtice. The <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw Dervis</hi> (who was very potent at the Port, and had a ſecret amity with the <hi>Baſhaws</hi> of <hi>Aſia</hi>) had a great inclination to aſſiſt them: He cauſed <hi>Jacaya</hi> to come to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> privately in the Habit of a <hi>Perſian</hi> Prieſt; the Conferences of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates are frequent and open; Plots are laid for depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Achmet,</hi> and advancing <hi>Jacaya</hi> to the Throne, and ſo probably, and forward were their deſigns,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:65131:197"/>his foot might have been ſaid to have been upon the firſt ſtep; but the very ſame day all things were to have been put in execution, the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor was diſcovered, and all the Princes hopes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the ſingle attempt of an eſcape. He put himſelf into the Train of a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ambaſſador who was returning to his Maſter, and rebaptizing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a new name <hi>(Hope)</hi> he followed his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour to <hi>Cracovia:</hi> This young Princes defign was to diſcover himſelf to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and to deſire Sanctuary in his Court; but by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements he heard by the way, he was divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that reſolution. His Affairs being great, and his Hiſtory ſingular, they were the ſubject of all Converſations; ſome ſaid <hi>Jacaya</hi> was dead, others he was retired to the Emperour of <hi>Germany.</hi> Every one playing the Polititian according to his own fancy, and arguing the ill conſequences his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat might bring upon them who received him, they gave the diſguiſed Prince to conſider his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge was to be choſen with all poſſible Caution. Before he would hazard himſelf, he concluded to take the ſecret advice of his friends; continuing therefore in his preſent condition, till he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their opinions; by his diligence and dexterity he had rendred himſelf ſo grateful to his Maſter, he was grown the greateſt Favourite he had in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. In this quality he became his Confident in an Intrigue he held with a <hi>Tranſilvanian</hi> Lady cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Metzala,</hi> whom the Wars of her Country had driven for protection into the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Court. This <hi>Metzala</hi> was very fair; the obligations betwixt them depended more upon utility than inclination;
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:65131:198"/>but ſhe was of ſo equitable a temper, ſhe did Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to the favours of Nature, in what object ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe met them. The outward condition of <hi>Jacaya</hi> could not diſguiſe, much leſs efface, the goodneſs of his Meen; and the Beauty of <hi>Metzala</hi> was of a degree which would have ſtagger'd the Loyalty of a more religious perſon than <hi>Mahomets</hi> Son. The Lady and this counterfeit <hi>Hope</hi> began to deſpiſe the obſtruction of their different Relations to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ambaſſadour. <hi>Metzala</hi> permitted the diſguiſed Prince to droll in her preſence, and to play upon the Age and Courtſhip of his Maſter: He took the boldneſs to make her ſeveral myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Preſents as new-years gifts, or offerings upon her Birth-day; and (having given and received oelliades both on one ſide and the other) <hi>Jacaya</hi> preſuming he was advanced ſo far, as that he might ſpeak his mind without danger of reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he writ a Letter imparting his thoughts, and carrying it himſelf, he delivered it to <hi>Metzala</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of another he was to have preſented from his Maſter. <hi>Metzala</hi> was at that time taking the air in her Balcony, when ſhe pretended <hi>Hope</hi> brought her the Letter. See, Madam, ſaid he accoſting her, a Preſent which perhaps you expected not: If it be welcom, I expect great reward from your Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence; if otherwiſe, your rejection will be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſufficient. <hi>Metzala</hi> took the Paper, and opening it, found theſe words.</p>

               <p>The trouble which was but too viſible in the face of <hi>Metzala,</hi> whilſt ſhe was reading this Letter, ſhe gave the diſguiſed Prince ſufficient conviction how ſhe was agitated within: She changed colour every time, and her heart forcing her to deſire what her reaſon hindred her to hope; ſhe was preparing for great queſtions, but had not leiſure to propoſe them; for a Lady of remarkable Quality came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Chamber at the ſame time. She compoſed her ſelf as well ſhe could, and paſſing out of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony to meet the Lady, You may tell your Maſter, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Jacaya,</hi> when I have examined the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond his Letter ſpeaks of, I will give him my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; as far as I have yet perceived, it doth not anſwer his Character. That, Madam, replied <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caya,</hi> is no wonder, the ſtone is ill ſet; and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſaid, as perhaps you may have obſerved, you muſt look further than ordinary to give it the true value. Well, we will ſee what it is, replied <hi>Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zala;</hi> making him a ſign to be gone; I ſhall not be abroad all day to morrow, bring it to me again
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:65131:199"/>after dinner. <hi>Jacaya</hi> withdrew after this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Lady which came in, being acquainted with the Amours betwixt the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and <hi>Metzala,</hi> ſhe concluded the Diamond they talkt of, was ſome new Preſent from him. She took no notice of her ſtiſpicion to <hi>Metzala;</hi> the friendiſhp betwixt them was not arrived at ſo high a confidence. Their diſcourſe were of the faſhions, of the times, and ſuch indifferent things; but as the greateſt part of that Sex are leſs frank and open among themſelves, than among men, ſhe was not ſo reſerved with the Ambaſſadour, as ſhe was with his Miſtreſs; ſhe went that very day to a Walk where ſhe met with him; ſhe cauſed her Coach to drive as near him as ſhe could, and thruſting her ſelf out of the Boot, What do you do here? ſaid ſhe ſmiling, you are expected, to recompenſe your late liberality. Your <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Officer hath done his beſt to make her prize it; had he been the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant himſelf, he could not have ſaid more of the Diamond. The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Lord could make nothing of that <hi>Aenigma,</hi> he would fain have had her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained it; but ſeveral Coaches having interpoſed, he could get to her no more: He drove immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to <hi>Metzala</hi> to inquire of her, and very earneſt he was to be reſolved. The <hi>Tranſilvanian</hi> ſmiled at his requeſt, pretending greater tranquillity than in juſtice he ought. This Droll <hi>Hope</hi> brought me one of your Letters after dinner, he makes always the pleaſanteſt ſport when he ſpeaks of your paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he ſaid your heart is a precious Stone, with which a Queen would think her ſelf honoured. This Lady came juſt in as he was in the Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:65131:199"/>and heard that expreſſion: See, I beſeech you how fools may put wiſer people into diſorder, and how unhappy we are that are forced to entertain them? But the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Lord was not to be coak'ſt; he did not take this ſhift of <hi>Metzala</hi>'s as ſhe expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it was a long time ſince he had been diſpleaſed with her courteſie to his man <hi>Hope.</hi> I beg of you, Madam, ſaid he, do not uſe that Boy to ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity. Thoſe kind of people are not born to be the objects of ſo much Generoſity; and what among us is but a natural Civility, paſſes among them for a preference, will make them inſolent: How can you admit ſuch a Fellow as he into the particulars of your affairs? If he brings you my Letters, and returns your Anſwers, I have taken care he ſhall do that faithfully, but do not you, Madam, inlarge his Commiſſion. <hi>Metzala</hi> could not hear him ſpeak ſo contemptibly of a perſon for whom ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to have a kindneſs, without ſaying ſomething in his defence. She told the Ambaſſadour, he did not know the treaſure he had in <hi>Hope;</hi> that he was a Servant he could not value ſufficiently: This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe confirmed the ſuſpicion of her Gallant, and he could not conceal it for his heart. <hi>Metzala</hi> found him injurious in his language, his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion anger'd her, and ſome ſmart Reparties did paſs betwixt the Lovers. The Ambaſſadour was an old Fornicator, had had more than one Love-quarrel in his time; he underſtood the difference betwixt Choler and Choler. He doubted not but <hi>Metzala</hi>'s anger had a touch of infidelity in it. He turned away <hi>Hope</hi> when he came home, and cauſed it to be told him by way of charitable advice, that if
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:65131:200"/>ever he came within <hi>Metzala</hi>'s doors again, he would meet with very ill Complements before he went away. This way the true courſe to fortifie the inclination of <hi>Metzala's.</hi> She apprehended (by an excuſe <hi>Jacaya</hi> fent her, for not waiting on her any more) what the Jealouſie of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour had done, and what would otherwiſe have been a blameable condeſcenſion, becoming now but a laudable compaſſion; ſhe was forced to make uſe of an undecent hour to inquire into affairs. He was brought privately into her Chamber, when ſhe thought all her Family was in bed: There was not an obliging word but her kindneſs dictated it to her Generoſity; ſhe was in bed, and Women which are naturally handſom, are much better in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture than dreſt. <hi>Jacaya</hi> was importuned to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain what <hi>Metzala</hi> found obſcure in her Letter; he told her his Birth, his Love to her, and the deſires of his Soul in words extremely ſuitable to his paſſion; but his narration was interrupted when it was juſt at the beſt, The jealous <hi>Polander</hi> had conceived ſhrewd ſuſpicions of the truth: All <hi>Metzala</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were at his diſpoſition, he cauſed them to be informed what it was he deſired of their zeal. Thoſe who were thought faſteſt aſleep, were broadeſt awake; and ſcarce was <hi>Jacaya</hi> got into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Miſtreſs, but the Ambaſſadour had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and ran immediately with two or three of his Servants, whither the Alarm invited: At the ſight of all that Company, <hi>Metzala</hi> was ſtrangely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, ſhe demanded of the <hi>Polander,</hi> what it was gave him the confidence to come to her at that time a night, and how long he had been accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:65131:200"/>to ſuch Viſits as thoſe. Do not you juſtifie your ſelf to your new Gallant, replied the Ambaſſadour with a tone of contempt, my deſign is not to let him ſee your gate is open to me at all hours in the night, I ſcorn to boaſt of a Conqueſt in which my Valet participates. At that word he ordered thoſe who came along with him to ſeize upon <hi>Jacaya,</hi> whom he took for no better than his man <hi>Hope;</hi> but he proved to be <hi>Mahomets</hi> own Son. For catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of the <hi>Polanders</hi> Cimeterre, wreſting it out of the Scabbard, and putting himſelf upon his guard, he ſatisfied his Maſter it would be no eaſie matter to have his Orders obeyed. <hi>Metzala,</hi> affrighted at the action, and apprehending for a man whoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction excuſed her reſentment, ſhe leapt in a rage out of bed, and cryed out for help: An Envoy from the Grand Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> who lodged not far from her Houſe, and came uſually very late home, hearing of her Cry, ran in to ſee what was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <hi>Jacaya</hi> knew the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Envoy, having ſeen him many times in the ſtreets: He deſired his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections, and in few words told him, he was that <hi>Ottoman</hi> Prince which made ſo much noiſe in the World. The <hi>Tuſcan</hi> had received private Letters before, that <hi>Jacaya</hi> was in <hi>Poland</hi> in diſguiſe. The Prince endeavoured to perſwade him to a belief; and though the <hi>Polander</hi> lookt upon the relation as fabulous, and conjured the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> to receive it no otherwiſe; yet he did not think fit to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by one who was ſo much concerned. He took the perſon of <hi>Jacaya</hi> into his protection till the morning, reſolving to carry him to the King to have the truth more ſtrictly examined; and he was
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:65131:201"/>found to be as he pretended: He had all the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Sultaneſs his Mother, of the Eunuch, and the Biſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica;</hi> he had Letters from ſome of the <hi>Baſhaws</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which they had lately writ to him under the name of <hi>Hope;</hi> and to daſh all ſcruples that might be pretended, there was a <hi>Chaous</hi> from <hi>Achmet</hi> at that time in the Court (who had been ſent to the revolted <hi>Baſhaws</hi> when he was amongſt them) which knew him. The teſtimony of this <hi>Chaous</hi> was irrefragable, and had not the malice of his offended Maſter, diverted his Majeſties inclinations, <hi>Jacaya</hi> had found the refuge and ſecurity he wanted, in the Court of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; but that incenſed perſon laid ſo many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments in his way, and contrived ſo many Plots againſt him, the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince thought it not pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent nor ſafe to ſtay there, and expoſe himſelf any longer. He tryed to have him aſſaſinated, he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented him to the King, and he had no ſooner cleared himſelf of one calumny, but he was aſperſed with another. He conjured the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Envoy to deliver him from this perſecution, and procure him a Retreat to the great Dukes Court: and the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> acquitted himſelf of that generous Act with zeal and ſucceſs. <hi>Jacaya</hi> departed for <hi>Florence,</hi> not without great trouble to <hi>Metzala;</hi> but ſhe muſt of neceſſity be patient. The Grand Duke received him with great kindneſs, and aſſigned him conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Penſions; the ſecret differences in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, ſeconded the liberality of the Duke; and the perſon of <hi>Jacaya</hi> being every way compleat, he became immediately the Love and Admiration of the whole <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Court; which though it be not
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:65131:201"/>altogether ſo great as other Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> yet the Ladies are naturally handſom in that Climate: not a <hi>Florentine</hi> Woman he ſaw, but could eaſily expunge the memory of <hi>Metzala.</hi> At firſthe plaid the generous Gallant; but not finding that kind of Courtſhip ſo agreeable with his mind, he reſtrained his deſires to the perſon of a young Lady called <hi>Angelicadi Strozzi,</hi> who was reputed the handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt young Woman in <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> Her Mother was dead, and the Marqueſs <hi>de Strozzi</hi> her Father, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been happy enough in his former Amours, to ſuſpect the vertue of all the Women in the World, he was a continual Watch upon his Daughter; ſo as ſhe never went abroad but to Church, or ſome other Feſtivals where her quality did indiſpenſably require her; and even on thoſe occaſions ſhe was attended by an old Widow her Kinſwoman, who would never truſt her out of her ſight. It coſt <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caya</hi> by that means many a ſigh before he could gain a favourable opportunity to explain himſelf; he endeavoured to have made his Eyes his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, but <hi>Angelica</hi> was at that time too young to underſtand that language. One night when they were making great Fire-works in the Grand Piazza at <hi>Florence,</hi> in joy for the Dutcheſſes being brought to bed of a Son, and <hi>Angelica</hi> was among the reſt of the Court-Ladies, looking out of the Windows; the Duke having called aſide the Marqueſs for his Judgment about the Fire-works which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood perfectly well: and the old Sentinel being removed upon ſome other occaſion, <hi>Jacaya</hi> thought beſt to take this opportunity, as not being able to aſſure himſelf when he ſhould have another.
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:65131:202"/>He got as near his young Miſtreſs as he could, and ſhewing her a Squib thrown into the air, which fell down with more than ordinary noiſe; So it is, Madam, ſaid he, with Lovers deſires, the conſtraint and confinement makes them more impetuous when they break forth; ſo that what ought not in ſtrictneſs to be ſaid under whole years attendance, ſeems in ſome meaſure to be excuſed, as ſoon as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is offered to ſpeak it. I love you, Madam, and I do it exceedingly. I am ſenſible of all the precautions Civility exacts of a Lover in order to this declaration: But, Madam, ſhould I imploy as much time in attending a convenient opportunity, as I have paſt already without meeting one, I ſhould dye without doubt before your Ladiſhip would underſtand my diſeaſe. The young <hi>Strozzi</hi> was ſo ſurpriſed at the diſcourſe, ſhe knew not what to anſwer, beſides ſhe had no time; for the old Scout perceiving their Converſe, flew back like Lightning to diſturb it. The Prince caſt many a glance upon his new Miſtreſs all the reſt of the night, or (to ſpeak more properly) he never took his Eyes off of her; he obſerved her much diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſhe lookt down upon the ground as ſoon as ſhe perceived him; but he apprehended there was more of modeſty than anger in her diſcompoſure. After the Fire-works were done, there was a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Supper, and after that a Ball. The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince took out <hi>Angelica</hi> to dance, and gave her all the intimations of his paſſion, that the vigilance of the old Marqueſs would permit him to give: He did not perceive <hi>Angelica</hi> do it, and none elſe of the Company came near enough to him, to convey any
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:65131:202"/>thing into his Pocket; nevertheleſs when he came to his Chamber, he found a little Table-book there with certain Lines in <hi>Italian</hi> to this purpoſe.</p>
               <q>Impetuoſity and ardour in fire which hath been long conſtrained, is pardonable; but the noiſe and cracking, is abominable.</q>
               <p>At the reading of theſe words, the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince was in as great a Tranſport, as a Lover could be. He doubted not but it was in Anſwer to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration he had made; and overjoy'd ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it ſo favourably, he paſt that night in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary hopes. The next day he went to Maſs to the Church where <hi>Angelica</hi> went ordinarily, where he obſerved a grave Matron attending him, and making ſigns to him now and then to follow him out of the Church: He ſubmitted to the ſignal; and the Matron demanding, if he had found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his Pockets over night; he was afraid at firſt to confeſs, leſt he ſhould do <hi>Angelica</hi> a miſchief before he was aware; but the old Woman obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his confuſion; Tell me truly, ſaid ſhe to him, for it was I that put the Table-book there, and the advice which is given comes from me: I am <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi>'s Nurſe; I was behind her yeſterday, when you had your diſcourſe, and I will promiſe to bring your affairs to a happy concluſion, provided you be diſcreet, and your intentions ſincere. Though it was great ſatisfaction to <hi>Jacaya</hi> to find an Agent ſo proper, and ſo ready to his hand, yet it could not but give him conſiderable regret to find <hi>Angelica</hi> had no ſhare in the Anſwer he had received; and
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:65131:203"/>he expreſt it to the Matron. Do not trouble your ſelf, ſaid the Matron to him, repoſe your ſelf upon me, I will do you what ſervice I can, for 'tis a long time ſince I have been preparing to be revenged upon the unjuſt ſeverity of the Marqueſs. His Daughter was not born ſo fair, to be lockt up in a Chamber, and we that are Governeſſes of ſuch Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as ſhe, have no way to make our ſelves conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable but by our addreſs in oſtentating our Talents. <hi>Jacaya</hi> concurred with every word ſhe ſaid, and ſeconding his approbation by a Ring he gave her off his finger, he made the Matron ſo firm to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, that that very day ſhe carried him a Letter to his Miſtreſs, and returned him an Anſwer. The Contents of her Anſwer was only a requeſt to him to write to her no more; but let a Ladies requeſt be what it will, ſhe makes a great advance when ſhe is induced to write again. The Nurſe inculcated her cares very much, and promiſed faithfully to continue them, and their ſucceſs was accordingly; their Commerce by Letters was eſtabliſht, and there began to be a conformity in their ſtyles. Things being in this poſture, the grand Dutcheſs would needs regale the Ladies of her Court at the <hi>Pratolin</hi> (which is one of the moſt beautiful Houſes of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> hath near <hi>Florence</hi>) <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica</hi> and her Convey were of the number of the Gueſts; by accident the Marqueſs <hi>de Strozzi</hi> was fallen into diſcourſe with <hi>Jacaya,</hi> who partly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and partly to make his advantage thereby, paſt ſo artificially from one ſtory to another, and kept the old man in a perpetual motion all over the Walks, that at length he tired him quiet. The
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:65131:203"/>Dutcheſs was at that time in a <hi>Salon</hi> of ruſtick work, built in the moſt ſolitary part of the Wood belonging to that Palace; four little vaulted Arbors were (as it were) attending on that great one: The Company weary of walking, was retired part into the <hi>Salon</hi> with the Datcheſs, and part into the leſſer Arbors by themſelves. The Marqueſs was of the laſt number; he entred into one of the little Arbors finding it empty, and being weary with walking, he was no ſooner ſate down, but he fell aſleep. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caya</hi> left him very civilly aſleep, and paſt to the Dutcheſs, to ſee if he could find out <hi>Angelica,</hi> and make any improvement of that opportunity: Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to inquire by accident of ſome of the Court, he underſtood ſhe was with her <hi>Argus</hi> in one of the Cabinets: He ſent a Gentleman of his Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to the old Matron, to let her know the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs would ſpeak with her on the other ſide of the Wood; and perceiving his deſign had taken, he went into the Arbor to ſupply her place till ſhe came back. The young Lady bluſht exceedingly when ſhe ſaw the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince, and would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately have been gone, but a ſecret inclination which ſhe could not overcome, prevailed with her to ſtay: <hi>Jacaya</hi> perceived her propenſity, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to fortifie her, he prayed, he promiſed, he preſt, his deſires were violent, and his paſſion elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. The Arbor in which this Scene was acted, anſwered exactly to the Arbor where the old Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs was aſleep, and by the effect of an Art which is common in all the grand Dukes Houſes (and of which we have formerly ſeen an Experiment in the Palace of <hi>Mary de Medicis</hi> built at <hi>Paris</hi>) that
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:65131:204"/>which was ſpoken in one of theſe Arbors, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed ſecretly into the other, without being percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by thoſe who were in the body of the Vault. This tranſportation of the voice from the Angle of one Vault to another, is not a Romantick invention of mine own to diſcover my Intrigue, for there is no body hath travelled into <hi>Italy,</hi> but will aſſure you of ſeveral places in the <hi>Pratolin</hi> built after that manner; and before one of the vaulted Chambers in the <hi>Palais d'Orleans</hi> was altered, it was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the ſame piece of Architecture. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs being ſo near, and in a place where he could hear diſtinctly all the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince ſaid to his Daughter, the carioſity of knowing who was the Miſtreſs ſet him perfectly awake: He liſtned at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, and underſtanding the promiſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Jacaya</hi> accompanied his Propoſitions; Yes, ſaid he to himſelf, that's the Dialect of all Lovers, I know that Leſſon without Book, and have made uſe of it to ſix ſeveral Ladies in my time, but the Women are meer Sots that believe a word of it. <hi>Jacaya</hi> preſſing hard, and <hi>Angelica</hi> not being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to grant him the favours he deſired, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs heard her anſwer: No, <hi>Jacaya,</hi> I cannot comply with the thing your deſires would exact; I am ſenſible I love you as well as is poſſible, and I muſt acknowledge there are certain minutes in which I wiſh my ſelf with you in the ſame liberty as now; but, Sir, the danger diſmays me, and it troubles me to think I am not able to do any thing for you now, but to manage my ſelf ſo as it may be in my power hereafter. But, Madam, replied the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince with ſome kind of impetuoſity, the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:65131:204"/>moments theſe conſiderations make you loſe, may perhaps be irrecoverable. The Stratagem I have uſed to ſend your old Sentry away, cannot laſt long, and perhaps your Father may wake at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant I am ſpeaking: do not therefore, I beſeech you, dear <hi>Angelica,</hi> conſume thoſe minutes which are intended only for Love, in tedious expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Prince incouraging himſelf by his own proper diſcourſe, would doubtleſs have been too hard for <hi>Angelica</hi>'s ſcruples; but her Name which <hi>Jacaya</hi> had mentioned, diſcovering the Intrigue to the Marqueſs, he fetcht ſuch a cry, as put our poor Lover beyond all his deſigns. <hi>Angelica</hi> made but one leap betwixt the place where ſhe was, to the Dutcheſſes <hi>Salon</hi> and the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince, being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the artifice by which the Marqueſs his cry was conveyed to his ears, believed he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and retired into the thickeſt part of the Wood, outragiouſly mad for the miſcarriage of his Enterpriſe. The Marqueſs had cryed out before he was aware, and durſt have ſworn almoſt he had done no ſuch thing; ſo that obſerving the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſilence which followed, and not perceiving what had cauſed it, he attributed it to a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect. Perſons of his humour and age do ſeldom interpret any thing for the beſt. The old Marqueſs aſcribing that to the exceſs of their Love, which was nothing but their fear, he ran into their Cabinet in a fury; and if he had found them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, as he expected to find them, it is clear he would have out run into deſperate extremities; but by good luck he found no body there but the old Matron, who having ſought him all over the Wood
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:65131:205"/>to no purpoſe, was returned to the Arbor where ſhe had left <hi>Angelica,</hi> at the ſame inſtant the Marqueſs came in alſo. The good man being in an anger, demanded very ſnappingly why ſhe had left his Daughter; and ſhe demanded of him as ſhort, why he took delight to make his Traps about the Wood, and through all the Walks about the Palace to no purpoſe. They gave account of their reaſons on both ſides; and the Marqueſſes ſuſpicions being aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by what ſhe related, nothing could ſerve his turn but he would go and ſtab his Daughter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Dutcheſſes face. But the reverend Matron reſtrained him as to that: She repreſented to his conſideration, that what was paſt was irreparable, and impoſſible to undo; that he muſt leave thoſe things to Deſtiny, and apply himſelf to the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch practices for the future. I know very well, ſaid ſhe, <hi>Jacaya</hi>'s Extraction places him above the Laws, which might conſtrain particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and though he would freely ſubmit, I am not ignorant that Princes are never without ſome reaſon of State or other in their Pockets, to keep them from performing that in their reſtabliſhment, which they promiſed in their affliction: But the moſt caſual Marriage will be better than that, what you believe is already conſummate betwixt the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince and your Daughter: Employ your ſelf ſeriouſly to make one of the Marriages we ſpeak of; and inſtead of ruining <hi>Angelica</hi> by an ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual diſcovery, conceal your reſentment, ſo that by a diſſembled confidence, you may haſten the moment of your ſatisfaction. The Marqueſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of her advice very well; he forced his Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:65131:205"/>as much as he could to compoſe his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and entring into the room where the whole Court was, he counterfeited that, and two or three days after ſo handſomly, the two Lovers apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were intirely laid aſide. They began to write Letters, as they had formerly done, and the Nurſe which managed the Intrigue, obſerving by her private diſcourſe with <hi>Angelica,</hi> that fear was the only impediment which kept her from ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deſires of the Prince, ſhe thought ſhe ſhould do a meritorious act, if ſhe could betray the innocent <hi>Angelica</hi> to a <hi>Rendez-vous,</hi> to which ſhe would not otherwiſe conſent. She ſaw her mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty made her reject all allurements of Love; but ſhe hoped time and accident might make her more happy. This hope having long ſince been digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>Jacaya</hi> well inſtructed in what he had to do, our female Engeneer found occaſion to have the Windows of a low Hall under <hi>Angelica</hi>'s Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, to be ſo altred, that the wooden Grilles or Bars might be taken out, and put in again with eaſe. Theſe Windows were no higher than the Butreſſes, and lookt into a by-ſtreet that was little frequented. The Nurſe complained that <hi>Angelicas</hi> Chamber was too hot, and the old Matron was brought to conſent ſhe ſhould change her Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The other being propoſed and approved, the day was appointed for their removal, and the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince had advertiſement not to loſe ſo fair an occaſion. He aſſured the Nurſe by a Ticket, he would not fail to be at the aſſignation; but by the continual care the Marqueſs took to know how things paſſed, this Ticket fell into his hands. It
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:65131:206"/>had no ſubſcription, and imported only thus much, That <hi>Jacaya</hi> would not fail to be at the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that night at eleven of the Clock. And now the old Marqueſs would have ſworn he had them ſure: He ſent for the Officers of the Town, and having diſpoſed them into a room, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to remain there ready to execute their Offices when required; the Marqueſs not daring to truſt any Scout but himſelf, clapt himſelf upon the Watch in a little Cloſet, built in the form of a Watch-houſe, from whence he could ſee all that went in or out of his houſe. The hour appointed by <hi>Jacaya</hi>'s Billet being come, the Marqueſs heard one while in the ſtreet, which he took at firſt for the ſignal, and indeed at that whiſtle the Porter opened the Gate gently, and let in a perſon covered all over from head to foot with a Cloak <hi>à l'Italienne.</hi> The Marqueſs made no queſtion but this was <hi>Jacaya,</hi> and lamenting the condition of perſons of Quality, to be expoſed to the infidelity of their Servants, he followed with his Eye to a Gallery correſponding to <hi>Angelica</hi>'s Chamber, into which none but her Women were permitted to enter. The Viſion knockt, and the door opened; there was not any place ſo ſecret in the houſe, into which that whiſtle would not have given her admiſſion. The old man thought he had ſeen enough, he ſent for his Judge and his Notary immediately, he put himſelf at the head of them with a lamp in his hand, and making the leaſt noiſe he could for fear of loſing his prey, by the ſecret orders he had given, he got preſently to his Daughters beds ſide. The kreak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſhooes in going, and the light of the
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:65131:206"/>lamp, having got before him to the Eyes and Ears of <hi>Angelica,</hi> ſhe clapt her head into the bed, and cauſed the party in bed with her to do the ſame. The Marqueſs drew the Curtain, and ſeeing two perſons in bed, he commanded the Judge to do his Office; and pulling a Daggar out of his Pocket, which he had brought with him on purpoſe, he ſwore a deſperate oath he ſhould marry his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or dye upon the ſpot. At theſe words of Judge, Death, and Daggar, <hi>Angelica</hi> threw her ſelf out of the bed, in a great fright, and eſcaping into a Cloſet on the inward ſide of her bed, ſhe fell a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricadoing the door with whatever ſhe could find. The Marqueſs not having ſo much occaſion for that part of his prey, as for the other, ſuffered her to go as ſhe would, and reſerved himſelf for what was behind. The Judge, the Notary, and ſome Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſelected for that deſign, ſeize upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, and haling it violently out of bed, the Marqueſs was ſtrangely ſurpriſed to find it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Daughters Nurſe: He cryed out it was none of ſhe he lookt for, he askt for <hi>Jacaya,</hi> and proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he would kill them every mothers child, if they did not tell him where he was. The old Nurſe underſtanding by that demand, what was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this diſorder, ſhe took heart, and with the grave and ſevere tone of a Matron, askt him if <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi>'s Chamber was a fit place to look for a man at that time of night. True it was, as was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Ticket, <hi>Jacaya</hi> was to have met that night in <hi>Angelica</hi>'s Appartment; but ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen from <hi>Provence</hi> having come to ſee the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Strozzi,</hi> that day, he had diſpoſed them
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:65131:207"/>that night into the Chamber appointed for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, and put off the young Ladies removal till the next. The Nurſe went out before noon to give <hi>Jacaya</hi> advice; and for the better diſguiſing of her <hi>Sally,</hi> ſhe went to ſee one of her Relations that was ſick, and had continued with her to the very hour in which the Marqueſs ſaw her come in: For knowing the Jealouſie of her Maſter, ſhe thought it not beſt to come home till ſhe belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he was in bed, leſt ſhe ſhould be troubled with the impertinent queſtions he uſed to all people that had been abroad. She had deſired the Porter to open the Gate when ſhe gave him the ſignal, as he did, and it was ſhe the Marqueſs had ſeen enter both into the Court and the Gallery belonging to his Daughters Chamber. The cunning old Fox being aſſured the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince was not to be found where he was ſought for, ſhe laid about her, and gave the Marqueſs all the reproaches ſhe could have given him, had ſhe been really innocent. She cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Porter to be called, to teſtifie it was ſhe that came in: ſhe would needs have him ſend to the ſick perſon, where ſhe had been viſiting, to ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whether ſhe was not newly come from thence; and purſuing her confidence ſo far as to preſs him to ſend to <hi>Jacaya,</hi> he did, and having found him in bed, ſhe put the poor Marqueſs into ſuch a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as he was never in before in his life. This ſtory made a great noiſe in the Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi>'s Court; ſome Ladies who emulated <hi>Angelica</hi>'s Beauty, and perhaps had their private deſigns upon the affections of <hi>Jacaya,</hi> began to talk of it at their pleaſure: <hi>Jacaya</hi> proteſted it was only the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:65131:207"/>old Marqueſſes fancy, and that he had never had any familiarity with his Daughter: But the good man, to juſtifie his ſenſes, and demonſtrate that his age had as yet done him no prejudice in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, gave a relation to all people of what he heard in the <hi>Pratolin;</hi> and pretended he had done the part of a wiſe man, when he had diſcovered upon what grounds he had done as he did. By this means was <hi>Angelica</hi> become the whole diſcourſe of the Court; and though ſhe was really innocent her ſelf, yet ſhe ſerved for an eminent Example, that in matters of Reputation, appearances are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as dangerous, as real tranſgreſſion. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Strozzi</hi> was very conſiderable in <hi>Italy;</hi> the Relations of <hi>Angelica</hi> were ſenſible of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince had done her, and <hi>Jacaya</hi>'s ambition not ſuffering him to apply ſuch publick remedy, as would have been required, the Counſel of the Grand Duke, after great diviſion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, concluded at laſt that the poor Prince ſhould be put to ſeek his protection from the Pope. But the malice of the <hi>Strozzi</hi> not regarding the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Protector, they laid ſo many ſecret pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices againſt his life, that they forced him out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and obliged him to paſs into <hi>France</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> newly come to the Dukedom of <hi>Mantua,</hi> whoſe Subjects refuſed to admit him into his State. The Court of <hi>France</hi> was at that time the moſt ſplendid in the World: The Marriage of of the young <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſupplied new matter to the Magnificence of the Queen Mother <hi>Mary de Medicis;</hi> and that time was ſo eminent for fair Ladies, that never was there ſo
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:65131:208"/>many Beauties together in one Court, as in his Reign. The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> having brought the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince into <hi>France,</hi> he would needs be his Patron amongſt them: He propoſed to him to accompany him in his Viſits to the moſt beautiful, and moſt eminent in Dignities; but the Prince ſtopping him at the firſt words of his Propoſition; I beſeech your Highneſs, ſaid he to the Duke, ſuffer me to forget there any ſuch Creatures in the World: I ſee the Ladies of this Court are tranſcendently handſom, but it ſatisfies me to look upon them at Court as ſo many pieces of good Painting; I will never purſue them to their own Houſes, if you will pleaſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe. How! ſaid the Duke, not ſee them, can you think to be in a Court ſo illuſtrious as this, and never viſit the Ladies? Ha! my dear Prince, <hi>Paris</hi> is not <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> you muſt viſit them here, or be expoſed to whatever their ſcorn or indignation can inflict; and you cannot imagine how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous the diſpleaſure of that Sex is for a perſon of your Age and Extraction: You may play the <hi>Turk</hi> in your own Country, but in <hi>France</hi> you muſt imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the <hi>French.</hi> I ought not any where to be lookt upon as a <hi>Turk,</hi> replied <hi>Jacaya</hi> a little angry, I came ſo young out of that Country, I have retained nothing of their Cuſtoms: My firſt years I ſpent in <hi>Greece,</hi> where they live with liberty enough; the Court of <hi>Poland</hi> is none of the ſtricteſt, and if one may believe the imaginations of the Marqueſs <hi>de Strozzi,</hi> continued he ſmiling, I, of all the World, have little reaſon to complain of the ſeverity of <hi>Italy.</hi> But, Sir, I deſire to be excuſed from any Amours in this Kingdom; and to preſerve my ſelf
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:65131:208"/>from the dangers which I have many times incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I tell you once again, I have no inclination to viſit any of your Ladies. I am too much your friend, replied the Duke, not to root out that obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate fancy; you will paſs for ſome pitiful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if you do not viſit the Ladies: And for the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers you ſpeak of, they are not ſo great as you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend: the multitude of Beauties obſtructing the choice, one can ſcarce give his heart to one, but the next fetches it again. That uncertainty preſerves many ſouls from the torture of Love; and if it ſo happens one ſhould be caught, a <hi>French</hi> Ladies Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant runs no harder Riſques than an ordinary Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And then not ſtaying for the Princes anſwer, he pulled him along with him by force, to two or three Ladies of his Acquaintance, and among the reſt the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> Ambaſſadours Wife, which was a very pleaſant Perſon, and ſpoke <hi>Italian</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well. But whatever theſe Ladies could do to ſignalize their Entertainment of <hi>Jacaya,</hi> they could not get the leaſt obliging Syllable from him: He fixt his Eyes upon the ground like a Novice of two days old, and anſwered with nothing but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſyllables. The Dukes friends laught at him next day for bringing ſuch a Spark into <hi>France:</hi> He found them altogether in the Ambaſſadreſſes Houſe, where they were at play, till it was time to walk. What Innocent is that you have got? cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they to the Duke, as ſoon as they perceived him: he is afraid to ſpeak one word, and to look a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the face, is as much as his life is worth; what do you with that poor Creature? or to what uſe do you deſign him? Ha! Ladies, replied the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:65131:209"/>Duke, he is nothing leſs, than what you take him for: He hath been told the <hi>French</hi> Ladies are much uſed to play upon Strangers; and not knowing the <hi>French</hi> Tongue very well, nor being yet acquainted with the Intrigues of the Court, he is afraid to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his diſcretion till he be informed better in both: But ſuch as you ſee him, if you could faſten him to your Chariot, I queſtion whether you ever tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpht with a more illuſtrious Captive in your life. Alas! ſaid one of the Ladies in a jeering tone, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that Honour muſt be left to a <hi>Venus</hi> in the Hangings, for whilſt he was in my Chamber, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded nothing elſe. I am of opinion, ſays ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame ſly way, the little <hi>Cupid</hi> by my beds ſide, is Rival to your <hi>Venus,</hi> for the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince was graciouſly pleaſed to vouchſafe him many a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable glance whilſt he was with me. For my part, ſaid the Ambaſſadreſs ſmiling, I have neither <hi>Venus</hi> nor <hi>Cupid</hi> to imploy the contemplation of the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s new friend; the Beds and Borders in my Garden were the only things he thought worthy of his Eye-ſight; and though he made me a large Viſit, was a whole day in my Chamber, and I diſcourſed with him in a Language he underſtood better than <hi>French;</hi> yet I dare lay a good Wager, he cannot tell whether I be fair or brown, little or great, and that he ſcarce remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers I was the Ambaſſadreſs of <hi>Savoy.</hi> You may proceed, Ladies, if you pleaſe, replied the Duke ſmiling, and paſs your Judgments upon the poor Stranger; but let me aſſure you, you are in an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour at this time; that Sultan <hi>Jacaya</hi> is one of the wittieſt perſons of this Age, and one of the greateſt
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:65131:209"/>Courtiers beſides. Ha! Monſieur, cryed the Ladies, as it were altogether, do us the honour to let us know what days they are in which he ſhews. Every day in the year, replied the Duke, provided he be not among Women. He knows you too well to talk before you; but if you will agree upon a place where I may make him ſpeak without knowing any body hears him but my ſelf, I do not queſtion but you will make his miſtaken merit an honourable amends. The bargain was made, and to be put in execution next day. They choſe the Houſe of the Mareſhal <hi>Baſſompierre,</hi> where there were ſeveral places convenient to conceal themſelves. A Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Houſe at the end of a Terrace-walk, which lookt upon the River, was deſigned for the <hi>Rendez-vous,</hi> and the Ladies being met at the hour appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> brought in his Monſter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a place where they could all hear him. After ſome preliminary diſcourſe about the ſituation of the Houſe (in which thoſe of them which were cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, confeſt he did well) the Duke cutting himſelf ſhort, and looking upon <hi>Jacaya</hi> with a ſubtile ſort of ſmile, Obſerve, ſaid he, this place, where in ſpight of the Beauty which you cannot but diſcern, I believe you but ſeldom appear, becauſe for the moſt part it is full of Ladies: The Mareſhal of <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſompierre,</hi> to whom it belongs, is a great Admirer of that beautiful Sex, and will not have his door ſhut againſt any that hath but the ſhape of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; therefore being ſo fine a Houſe, and at the very Gate of <hi>Paris,</hi> 'tis odds if at this very hour there be not five or ſix Ladies, which conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſome of the ſolitary places. As to them,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:65131:210"/>replied the Prince ſmiling in his turn, my care is at an end: the Viſits you forced me to make ſome days ſince, will preſerve me againſt their Charms; for after the rate that I deported my ſelf with thoſe which I ſaw, I am miſtaken if they will not ſhun me as much as I can avoid them for my heart. 'Tis true enough, ſaid the Duke, you were very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous (if you will give me the liberty to tell you ſo) I thought ſo my ſelf, more than they did, replied <hi>Jacaya,</hi> and when I think of the perſon I have act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I know not how I could have the power to do it. To tell you the truth, replied the Duke, it was not at all natural. Alas! no, perſiſted the Sultan with a ſigh, I am nothing leſs than indifferent for Ladies, or diſtracted in their Companies; on the contrary, I am born not only inclinable, but paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for that Sex. I cannot ſee a handſom Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but ſhe is ready to draw my Eyes out of my head, and gives me ſo pleaſant a commotion I am not able to define it. I love ardently, I love nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I devote my ſelf wholly to what I love; and am convinced in this life there is no pleaſure ſo great as to be beloved where one loves. But hitherto Love hath ſeemed incompatible with my ſafety, and with the juſt ambition of my mind: It di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs all my deſigns, it drives me from all my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, and no ſooner can I entertain the very ſhadow of an Intrigue, but the malignity of all the Conſtellations do ſeem to declare againſt me. Make therefore no more Combinations againſt my tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, continued he ſmiling; for I am at length reſolved to love nothing for the future, and I am of opinion ſhould ſooner break with you, than be
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:65131:210"/>prevailed upon by your perſwaſion to love any thing again. You have cleared your ſelf of their Ambuſcadoes in very good health, replied the Duke with a tone tending to Raillery. The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs yeſterday was ſaying in merriment, you knew not whether ſhe was handſom or otherwiſe; How! ſaid the Prince with a little more red than ordinary in his Cheeks, ſhe was very much miſtaken, never any Woman of her Excellence eſcapt my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor dare I confeſs all the impreſſions ſhe made upon my heart. Why! replied the Duke, being ſomewhat ſurpriſed, hath the Ambaſſadreſs given you any impreſſion? I durſt have ſworn your Eye had not been long enough upon her, to have known her from another Woman. Ha! good Sir, ſaid <hi>Jacaya</hi> to the Duke, you are too po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick, you have a mind to inveigle my heart, and I am afraid are ingaged, if poſſible, to intangle it: Do not command me to give you a deſcription of the Ambaſſadreſs, we muſt always be tender of ſpeaking of what we would not keep conſtantly in our mind; let it ſuffice I know her proportions very well, and that the luſtre of her comely black Hair, the vivacity of her Eyes, the Majeſty of her Shape, the ſweet and obliging Air expanded all over her body, her fine Mouth, and her incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Teeth, were never obſerved more ſtrictly, nor with more veneration than by me. I know fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that Nature hath ſeemed to pleaſe her ſelf in giving her the Arms and Neck of a fat Woman, with the ſhape and proportion of a lean: The Ladies who had no ſhare in <hi>Jacaya</hi>'s <hi>Elogium,</hi> thought it high time to interrupt him; they ſallied
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:65131:211"/>out of their Reconditory, and crying out to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> Pardon us, Sir, we recant, the Prince of <hi>Turkie</hi> is as gallant and courtly as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe him; they acquainted <hi>Jacaya</hi> with their Conſpiracy againſt him, he reprehended the Duke by a ſignificative look, and to render their deſign ineffectual then, and diſcourage his friend from ſuch Plots for the future; he returned home to his own Lodgings, in ſpight of all the Ladies impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to the contrary. This kind of deportment ſet them all into a loud laughter, Come back, Sir, come back, cryed they to the fugitive Prince, we will promiſe you Quarter; do not be afraid of your heart, we know a way to ſecure it. But the Prince marcht on to his Coach without ſeeming to hear them: The Ambaſſadreſs, who was naturally amorous, and according to the inclination of her Sex, could not but hold her ſelf obliged to the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Prince for the Character he had given her, told her Companions it was an affront to them to have a man run from them in that manner; and that if ſhe might adviſe, they ſhould make him repent of his inſolence. They liked her counſel very well, they had none of them any deſign upon the heart of <hi>Jacaya,</hi> they had already as many of thoſe as they could tell how to manage; but they thought it pleaſant to torment the poor Prince. The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> promiſed to aſſiſt them; he did not look upon it as any defect of the friendſhip he had promiſed them, to deliver him up to three or four the handſomeſt Ladies in the World, at their earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt requeſt. <hi>Jacaya</hi> came not into the Queens Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, but through twenty or thirty <hi>oeillades;</hi>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:65131:211"/>the Ladies of the League, gave the word to ingage him by turns, every one in a particular converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the pretence they made uſe of, rendring their deſire but merriment, it was no ſtrange thing for a perſon of quality to be ſeen walking with the Sultan, or in entertaining him otherwiſe alone. Ha! Ladies, ſaid he to them one day, I am here in my <hi>Aſylum,</hi> do not violate the Priviledges of the place, by endeavouring the Captivity of my heart. Alas if you had it, you knew not how to uſe it; I know the humour of the <hi>French</hi> Ladies already, their greateſt weakneſs is their levity. In the Countries from whence I come, they are conſtant; they ſpeak nothing, but they think; and when they think a thing, all their care is to put it honeſtly in execution: Thoſe Ladies would be much troubled to deſtroy a man; but in this Court, the Goddeſs moſt adored is Pretence. Great liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, great kindneſs: Society is not only permitted, but commanded; and when of that, which in another Country would be all, we endeavour to make our advantage in this; we find that all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to juſt nothing. Quarter therefore, Quarter, fair Ladies, for a poor Stranger. The <hi>French</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were generous, and conceiving they had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted themſelves long enough with what they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained at firſt only for their diverſion, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think of letting the poor Sultan alone, to enjoy himſelf after his own Mode. But the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadreſs was not ſo indulgent; in her judgment <hi>Jacaya</hi> demanded Quarter in ſuch a way as was not fit to be granted. She found him in the <hi>Thui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> one day and accoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:65131:212"/>him; May one be ſo bold, Sir, ſaid ſhe to the Sultan, paſſing near him, as to deſire the honour of your Uſherſhip? No, Madam, replied <hi>Jacaya,</hi> you are too handſom at this time; and having ſaid ſo, he made a low Reverence with deſign to have been gone; but the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> catching him by the Arm; It ſhall never be ſaid, ſaid he, you made your friends bluſh for your incivility towards the Ladies. Sir, ſaid the Prince to the Duke, with ſome diſcontent in his countenance, I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with your manner of uſage; and if you anger me any further, I will fall in Love with the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadreſs. The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> bluſht indeed at that menace, without knowing the reaſon. He could not get it out of his head during the reſt of their Converſation; and taking the Sultan home with him to Supper, he demanded of him very ſeriouſly if he were in earneſt, when he ſaid he would love the Ambaſſadreſs of <hi>Savoy.</hi> It was not yet come to a reſolution; but the Sultan, who had a mind to be merry in his turn, and obſerved the Duke askt him that queſtion with ſome little commotion, he was glad of that occaſion to revenge himſelf. Yes, Sir, ſaid he very gravely, I am moſt certainly in earneſt; do not you think her worthy of being beloved? 'Tis not of her worth I ſpeak, replied the Duke, the queſtion is, whether ſhe will love you again: What would you ſay, ſaid the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince, if ſhe be in Love with me already? I will ſay you are a happy man, replied the Duke. Read theſe Verſes then, ſaid <hi>Jacaya;</hi> and giving him a Table-book out of his Pocket, the Duke opened it, and found theſe words.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Now, Sir, ſaid the Prince of <hi>Turkie</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> what is your opinion? would not one
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:65131:213"/>reſolve to love upon leſs ſollicitation? I confeſs, replied the Duke, theſe are of importance; but tell me ſincerely, is it the Ambaſſadreſs who invites you from your indifference in this manner? You are very ſtrange in your queſtions, replied the Prince ſmiling, am I not indiſcreet enough of my ſelf, but your affected incredulity muſt render me more ſo? Had the Duke told the Sultan at the ſame time of his own affection for the Ambaſſadreſs, it was then in time, and <hi>Jacaya</hi> had ſuppreſt his natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: But the Duke diſſembled as well as he, and told the Sultan he was glad of his good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. In the mean time it is not to be imagined, the effect this Juggle of <hi>Jacaya</hi>'s produced in the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s mind: Till that very minute he never perceived he loved the Ambaſſadreſs; but when he examined the ſecret diſpleaſure it was to him, to believe the Sultan in her affections, he doubted not but that diſpleaſure aroſe from an ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Love. He paſt away that whole night in deteſting the ignorance of his paſſion, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to himſelf what he had done towards the making of that Intrigue, which diſturbed him, he could not ſufficiently admire the oddneſs of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny. As ſoon as ſhe was to be ſeen the next day, he made a Viſit to the Ambaſſadreſs, and found her tranſlating a piece of <hi>Paſtor Fido</hi> out of <hi>Italian</hi> into <hi>French.</hi> The Lady being as courteous as witty took great pleaſure in giving the Sultan intelligence, of the <hi>French</hi> Language, by her Tranſlations out of <hi>Italian,</hi> which <hi>Jacaya</hi> underſtood perfectly well. With this deſign it was ſhe gave the Prince the firſt fragments in his Table-book; and had the Duke
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:65131:213"/>conſidered, he would have remembred the ſenſe was there exactly in the Scene of <hi>Silvio</hi> and <hi>Linco;</hi> but he was ſo ſtrongly perplext with jealouſie and anger, he had not time for any ſuch reflexions. Is it <hi>Jacaya,</hi> Madam, ſaid he in a biting way to the Ambaſſadreſs, which imploys your Poetical Vein? Yes, replied the Ambaſſadreſs, not obſerving the manner of his pronounciation, how do you know it is for him I put my Wit upon the Tentars? <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caya</hi> is not endued with ſo much diſcretion, replied the Duke to let his friends be ignorant of any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours he receives from the Ladies. Ha! Sir, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Ambaſſadreſs, the favours he receives from me are common to all the perſons of Worth which I know, if they be ignorant of the <hi>French</hi> Tongue. I find at my arrival at this Court they did me an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme pleaſure to make me perfect in that Language, and I am endeavouring to do the ſame kindneſs to <hi>Jacaya:</hi> He doth not receive the effects of your goodneſs, Madam, replied the Duke, in that way; and then he gave her an account of all that paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Jacaya</hi> and him. He deſigned to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed her by that information, and obliged her to have baniſht <hi>Jacaya</hi> from her Company. But his intelligence produced a contrary effect. <hi>Jacaya</hi> was one of the moſt accompliſht Princes in the World, and our <hi>Savoyenne</hi> diſcerned too well, to be ignorant of his perfections. Nevertheleſs, the leſs ſhe obſerved the Punctilioes uſual upon ſuch occaſions, ſhe complained highly of <hi>Jacaya</hi>'s indiſcretion, and affecting to paſs by him without any Salute, ſhe perſwaded the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> ſhe was really an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry. In that opinion he was very well pleaſed, and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:65131:214"/>his Love became ſo violent, it was no eaſie matter for him to conceal it. The Sultan, who had ſpoke truer than he intended, perceiving his threat was effectual in earneſt, ſpared not by all means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate his affairs. Tell me, Madam, I beſeech you, ſaid he one day to the Ambaſſadreſs, what is it a man muſt do to deſerve your Eſteem? The reſpect I bear you, ſavours too much of timidity: That Character I know doth not pleaſe you, you have been ſo often pleaſed to expreſs your ſelf to that effect, that I might take another upon me. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to obey you, I follow you where-ever you go, I entertain you as often as I can, and could I believe you would hearken graciouſly to what I ſhould ſay, I could tell you great things: But you ſeem to grow cold at the leaſt ſignification of my flame; and having no inclination to hear any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſpeak, but when they are reſolved to be ſilent, your Curioſity ceaſes as ſoon as I prepare my ſelf to ſpeak. My Curioſity did not expect to have heard from the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> that you were my Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, replied the Ambaſſadreſs ſomething tartly: Why? Madam, ſaid the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince, did the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> inform you ſo? Yes, doubtleſs, replied the Ambaſſadreſs, he is too much my friend not to give me notice of your indiſcretion. He is mine too very much, Madam, replied <hi>Jacaya,</hi> the kindneſs he hath done me is a ſufficient teſtimony; I could not have expected it from him, and (if I may have liberty to ſay ſo) it was but by chance I diſcovered that ſecret to him. But he hath made the beſt uſe of it for me, and ſaved me many a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement: You know now I love you, without my
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:65131:214"/>trouble of ſwearing it; and I may imploy all that time which would have been neceſſary to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded you to it, in uſing my beſt means to make you love me. The Ambaſſadreſs found this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſo pretty and ſingular, ſhe had not power to keep her countenance any longer, but fell out into a laughter. Some Lovers, continued the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince, would have been offended at this effuſion of mirth; but I am not of their opinion, I hold it pleaſant any ways to divert the perſons we love; and ſince you are ſo pleaſed with my aſſurances, 'tis an Entertainment I ſhall give you as often as I may. As he promiſed, he performed; When at any time he ſaw the Ambaſſadreſs ſerious: Reſume your good humour, Madam, ſaid he, I love you no leſs at this inſtant, than when my aſſurances put you into ſuch a fit of laughter. When ſhe was gay, and merry (as ſhe generally was) my affairs go on now very well, ſaid <hi>Jacaya</hi> to her, you ſee without doubt my paſſion written in my Eyes, being in the ſame hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in which I found you the firſt time I profeſt it. The Ambaſſadreſs forced her ſelf as much as ſhe could to be ſevere; but her ſeverity would not hold againſt the inſinuation of the Sultan: She ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed her ſelf inſenſibly to hear him tell her he loved her, till that cuſtom became a habit, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a paſſion in her wherewith the Sultan had good reaſon to be content. The Duke of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> was too much affected with that Intrigue, not to pry into the bottom of it: He advanced ſo far as to give the Ambaſſadreſs his judgment of it, without declaring the true motive which impelled him. She received his advice as a piece of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantery,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:65131:215"/>and paying in counterfeit Coin what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in true, ſhe turned all <hi>en ridicule.</hi> He would have ſpoke more intelligibly, and to the charitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his advice, added another Epithet that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to it; but his Love was no happier than his Jealouſie. Ha! ſaid the Ambaſſadreſs to him, you have not taken a right Copy of Prince <hi>Jacaya.</hi> by your looks one would imagine your diſcourſe were ſerious. I intend it no otherwiſe, Madam, replied the Duke, the paſſion wherewith you have inſpired me, is (in my judgment) the ſeriouſeſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair I can treat of. That part doth not agree with you at all, Sir, replied the Ambaſſadreſs, I know you are but merry, and ſhould I take your pretences for truths, I ſhould likewiſe deſire you to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber who I am; but I am not ſo eaſily deluded. Why do you now tell me you love me? are my Charms any greater now, than they have been theſe two years that you have been expoſed to them? No, Sir, you do but railly, and (give me leave to ſay) not with the neatneſs and dexterity, is to be expected from an ingenious man; and ſeeing the Prince of <hi>Turkie</hi> come in at the ſame time, Come hither, Sir, ſaid ſhe ſmiling, come hither, and let me hear ſome of your Amours before the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> that he may diſcern the difference, and begin a new Leſſon; for two hours together he hath been endeavouring to imitate you, but could not attain. I am to day, Madam, replied the Sultan, in no humour to make Love; you lookt upon me this morning at Maſs, in ſuch a way as hath diſcompoſed me for all this day: I could not diſcover the leaſt ſpark of kindneſs in your Eyes.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:65131:215"/>Tell me, I beſeech you, is it enough for a Lover, that they be ſparkling without kindneſs? or do you think they have acquitted themſelves of their duty, when they have dazled a poor Creature? I muſt ſee Love in them, or renounce their Empire; and when mine declare I love more than ever, I expect yours ſhould make anſwer, <hi>And I'le aſſure you there's no Love loſt.</hi> If that be all, replied the Ambaſſadreſs, rather than the Duke ſhall want his Leſſon, I'le look upon you as you pleaſe. Do I look well now? continued ſhe, fixing her Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with as much tenderneſs as ſhe could. Ha! I know you, dear Eyes, ſaid the Sultan, I ſee now you are diſpoſed to hear me; and then he ran out into a thouſand amorous expreſſions, but the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> (who took no recreation in that kind of divertiſement) interrupted him, by departing ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily out of room. <hi>Jacaya</hi> obſerved his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy ſo changed, he was afraid he had been ill, and deſired the Ambaſſadreſs ſhe would permit him to follow him, which he did, but could not overtake him till he came to his Lodgings. The Prince of <hi>Turkie</hi> deſired to know, what it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him to retire ſo abruptly, and aſſured him the Ambaſſadreſs was very unquiet till ſhe could be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of his health. The Duke being brim full of paſſion, anſwered not the Sultans Complement; but looking fiercely upon him with his Eyes, in which grief and rage were both livelily delineated; <hi>Actum eſt,</hi> it is decreed, cryed he, I love her; my Love hath not been thus long conſtrained, but to break out with the greateſt violence, and I will periſh a thouſand times before I will endure my Rival ſhall
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:65131:216"/>be beloved. <hi>Jacaya</hi> thought him in a Phrenſie, and taking him by the Arm to feel his Pulſe, What do you talk of a Miſtreſs, and a Rival? you are in a burning Feaver, do you remember who it is that ſpeaks to you? Yes, Prince, replied the Duke, with ſomewhat more moderation, I know you too well, you are the Ambaſſadreſſes Darling, but you muſt reſolve to take away my life, or renounce thoſe addreſſes. Why, Sir, ſaid the Sultan in a great ſurpriſe, do you love the Ambaſſadreſs? To ſay I love her, replied the Duke, is too mean; I admire, I adore her, and either you muſt reſign, or one of us muſt dye. <hi>Jacaya,</hi> confounded at this Alarm, as may well be imagined, fell down upon the Chair that was next him, and leaning his Elbow upon the Table, fell into a contemplation of his Deſtiny. He loved the Ambaſſadreſs entirely, and though his paſſion was begun in ſport, and continued in a Frolick; yet at the bottom he was moſt abſolutely ſerious. He was of an amorous Complexion, much ſubject to Love, and in that reſpect it was no eaſie matter for him to renounce it; on the other ſide, he had been infinitely obliged to the friendſhip of the Duke, he had protected him againſt the Conſpiracies of the <hi>Strozzi;</hi> he had given him all neceſſary ſupplies, and he had never been admitted in <hi>France,</hi> but by his means. Love! Ha, cruel Love, cryed he with a ſigh, will you be always mine Enemy? Alas! Sir, ſaid he, addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Duke, I foreſaw the miſery is befallen me; and had you left me in that liberty I deſired, I had never pulled it down upon me: Had you no other way of breaking with me, than by making me your
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:65131:216"/>Rival: I ſuppoſe my friendſhip hath tryed you, and I do not admire it; the unfortunate are often tedious to their friends; but had it not been enough to let me have known ſo, without adding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of an infructuous paſſion? Do not call me to an account, ſaid the Duke, for what I have done; I knew nothing of it my ſelf, and would have ſworn I ſhould never have been in Love with the Ambaſſadreſs: The very moment before I knew ſhe had a kindneſs for you, my Love began to declare, by the approaches of my Jealouſie; the news of your being in Love ſet me alſo on fire; and that fire having been a long time depreſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly in my heart, that part of it which appears but its beginning, is indeed the utmoſt extremity. It is not that I am weary of your friendſhip, and I offer you mine as pure as you have found it; But, dear Sultan, ſhew me your compaſſion by your compliance; Ladies are unconſtant, and perhaps you will do that of your ſelf one day, either out of wearineſs or revenge, that I conjure you to do now in kindneſs to me. The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prince could not reliſh that Propoſition; all that his obligations and Policy could get from him, was only a promiſe to endeavour to maſter himſelf. In order to which he abſented himſelf for ſome time, and pretending a Curioſity to ſee the Kings Houſes, and other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces about <hi>Paris,</hi> he had ſeveral Entertainments with ſeveral Lords of the Court. Whether in ſome of thoſe Entertainments the Duke of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> laid any deſign for him; or whether the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his misfortune in his Love exſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated him to retire into ſome unknown part of the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:65131:217"/>World, where that paſſion was a ſtranger, is not known; but certain it is, he diſappeared in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and could never afterwards be heard on. The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> was not much happier; for the Ambaſſadour dying in <hi>France,</hi> and his Lady re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Dukes Affairs called him into <hi>Italy,</hi> and gave him no leiſure to abandon himſelf to the deſires of his paſſion.</p>
